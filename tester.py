    "mmmmgmmmmm mmSmmmw . jgt IF YOUR GROCER DOESNT SELL YOUkS, FRESH FOOD, GET A NEW GROCER, SAYS DR. WILEY By Dr. H. W. Wiley. It is all well enough to de scribe food adulteration and tell about the gasy methods for its de tection and to mention instances of gross misbranding. But if these things are mentioned only in an academic way they may serve to interest but not to pro tect. The practical point is how and where can the. housewife pro cure pure food, true to the name? First of all the housekeeper must depend upon her grocer. Grocers are sometimes abused and maligned, but it is doubtless true that they are as honest as the members of any other profession Most of them are reliable and.it is only the few who are dishonest. Let the housewife, study the char acter of her groder carefully. If he is not what he should be she can easily find someone who is. But it is not always necessary to change your grocer if he is found to be selling an adulterated article. He may be ignoraat of it himself and a word or a hint from the housewife may set him straight. In fact it may be said that every grocer who wishes to ) succeed in business, and, I sup pose that every one does, seeks to minister to the desires of his cus tomers and if they demand pure, wholesome and first-class food he is very apt to give it to them. On the other hand, many groc ers sell adulterated, low grade products becatKe-theirJcgslmeT want that kind of goods. An ef fort should be made to seggregate the bad business, in the hands of one set of grocers, from the good business in the hands of another. The housewife, then, has an easy method of making her choice. If a grocer persists in selling her bad articles there is only one course left for her to pursue an4 that is to withdraw her custom. In the second place the house wife should carefully study the problem of pure food. If she .buys fish she should ask the deal er how fresh it is, how long he has had it, if ityhas been frQzen and if this is the first time it has been exposed for sale. She should study its eyes and mouth to see if it is a freshly caught fish, or whether it has been frozen for one or more summers. A few in quiries of this kind and an in spection of the condition of the fish will warn the dealer that he need not offer any but the fresh article to that customer. The housewife should also study carefully into the grosser forms of adulteration and decep tion which are practiced in the so called package goods. They are apt to be too old. They are often mouldy and should always have careful inspection. . The grocer should be asked when they were packed and if they contain all the articles called for. I Package; goods are often put up wnto sizes to simulate, certain,",

Dont for get this. Baking Calumet Fo wderi Economy is the most important problem a housewife has to deal with in baking. Every housewife in the city of Rock Is- land is studying methods of economy in these days of high cost of living. Calumet Bak ing Powder first insures won derful saving in . baking, but, it does even more than this it insures wholesome food, tasty food and uniformly rais ed food. The reason for this is very simple. The materials (BAKING POWDER)! or made by the 1 EUME1 in Calumet are so carefully selected and perfectly adapted to all baking, and then so scientifically proportioned that failures in baking are im possible. It is not economy when you buy the cheap or big can baking powder. When you buy Calumet, you , buy the highest quality. R eceived Highest Awards Calumet has received the HighestAward at the Worlds Pure Food Exposition, Chicago, 111., and at the Paris Exposition, France, March, 1912e Every housewife interested in reducing the High Cost of Living and in the use of pure baking powder is advised to write to the Calumet Baking Powder Co., 201 E. Ohio Street, Ch icago, for a beautifully illustrated cook book. This book contains 272 pages of valuable recipes and important information for the housewifes use.",

Id love to be a housewife! I would love to spend my day In a oozy little kitchen while the moments sped away! With the nicey, spicy odors, homey, and yet sharp and strange, And the genial warmth proceeding from the cun ning little range; With the mysteries of cooking and the knowl edge of the power To turn out a fresh creation of ones genius every hour; Oh, the drudgery of rhyming is a tame and thank less thing I should love to be a housewife that my very soul might sing! Id love to be a housewife! Making beds and sweeping floors Washing windows, if I chanced to need some ex ercise outdoors; Neer a fear of boss or foreman with its constant, prodding pain; Just the simple round of duty, with the mind at perfect rest. Thinking thoughts of love and beauty free, and giving forth its best; Oh, the world with all its worries is a falsehood and a snare And I fain would be a housewife, free from every earthly care! Would that I had been a housewife! Naught an noys her, year by year, But the tinner and the plumber when the bath rooms out of gear, And the grocer and the garbage and the babies and the rugs, And the garden and the furnace and the roaches and the bugs, And the neighbors with their gossip and the Ice man with his dirt, And a slouchy, grouchy husband with the but tons off his shirt Oh, Its fine to be a housewife, sheltered from the madding mob, (But a man that digs a sewer has a sweeter, easier job.)

    "Hi UNCLE 5An3 CHEESE BOOK FOR MRS. HOUSEWIFE (Editors note: Uncle Sam thinks we are not eating enough cheese. It is his idea that with more cheese on the family table we will wax richer in pnrse and fatter of body. The department of agriculture has prepared a cheese book, pointing out the value of cheese to the inner man, and giving many cheese dishes. These wilL appear from day to day in The Day Book under the title UncIe.Sams Cheese Book.It will pay you to cut them out each day and paste them in a small blank book for future refer 1 ence. By Uncle Sam. Cheese is used in general in two ways in small quantities chiefly for its flavor, and in large quantities for its nutritive value, as well as its flavor. Those which are used for their flavor, many of which are high priced, contribute little to the food value of the diet, because of the small quantity used at a time. They have an im portant part to play, however, in making the diet attractive and palatable. Those cheeses which are suit able to be eaten in large quanti ties and which are comparatively low priced, important for their flavor and nutritive value as well, are known to the trade ..stand ard factory cheese, and to the American housewife as American cheese. It is the regular, round cheese of the grocery store. This particular variety is referred to when the word cheese is used without specification in the reci pes to follow. Cheese has nearly twice as riiuch protein, weight for weight, as beef of average consumption and its fuel value is more than twice as great. It has a larger per cent of both, protein and fat than steak, eggs, potatoes, milk, or bread, and therefore is one of the very best foods that you can have on your table. Cheese does not cause constipa-j tion or other physiological dis turbances that have erroneously, been charged to it. When cheese takes the place of meat as the central dish of a meal, the housewife should have fresh vegetables or fruits as a contrast to the concentrated and fatty cheese. Harder kinds of bread should be used, such as crusty rolls, toast, rye bread, the harder brown bread or crackers. CHEESE SAUCE One cupful of milk, 2 table spoonfuls of flour, 1 ounce of cheese ( cupful of grated cheese), salt and pepper. Thicken the milk with tKe floor",
    "it measures such as pounds, quarts, or pints. These packages bear no statement of weight or measure and probably are not sold by weight or measure, but they give an impression to the customerof a certain definite quantity. The housewife will gain great profit by inquiring just how much pack age goods she is receiving and she wijl often be surprised. The housewife should beware of the fluffy ruffles variety of foodJThere is a tendency to puff Up everything that is made to make it big in bulk while at the same time it is light in weight. Bottles are thicker than is neces sary for safety and the dent in the bottom sometimes extends al-H most to the center. Cereal foods are flaked or rolled so as to ac cupy an immense bulk with light weight and while there may be no intention of deception there exists a general impression of re ceiving more than one gets. (Dr. Wiley will continue his talk to the housewife on market ing for pure, fresh, money worth foods in his article Mon day.) o o WEATHER REPORT JKain bunday hs& .bair tonight, fol lowed by unsettled weather and prob ably showers Sun day, for Chicago vicinity; no import ant change in tem perature ; moderate to brisk east erly winds, . - r fettled YOUNG GIRL CARING FOR TITANIC ORPHANS N New York, April 20. Two lit tle Titanic orphans, saved with a lap dog, and wholly uncon scious of the tragedy of their lives, are playing today at the home of Miss Margaret Hays. No one knows who they are, nor where their honie is. No ope knows if they have any living rel atives. They are just two little Waifs of the greatest sea disaster of history. The older is about four years old, a curly-haired, bright-eyed, little Frenchman, who spends most of his time trying to amqse his two year old companion. The other may be his brother, but no one knows for certain whether or no he is. Margaret Hays was saved on the last lifeboat to leave the Ti tanic. The boat had been lowered into the water, the crew were prepar ing to pull off, when a wild cry came from the deck of the sinking ship. A Frenchman, ,carrying two naked babies in his arms, ap peared at the rail. He shouted to the crew of the lifeboat, crying to them to save the babies ; then hurled the older one into the outstretched arms of a sailor. Wfth the tears streaming down his face, murmuring prayers, he hugged the younger baby to his breast, smothering its facewith a last farewell kiss. Then he tossed him, too, to safety.",
    "THE MUNICIPALHOUSEWIPET TT1 The stockyards at Chicago, with its 10 square miles of filthy yards and alleys and its streets half the time under water, was about the meanest proposition in the way of street cleaning ever offered a ward superintendent. It was clearly a job for a hard-headed, practical man who could deal firmly with rough necks and didnt mind bad smells. But Miss Anna Murphy, young and good looking, got the job. She has passed the civil service examination and there was no denying her. A good many people thought that was pushing the new woman idea just a trifle beyond the limit of common sense. Anna Murphy didnt think so. , She had a meager appropriation, but like a good housewife she made it go around. First she cleaned up the alleys, then white washed the fences, next established and strictly enforced .regulations to care for garbage. Finally she piled the refusefrom the alleys in the water-soaked streets, and had it covered with ashes and gravel before it was aware of it, and the stockyards district had a beauti ful new highway built without cost as anincident to cleaning up. the ward. Now Chicago is wondering if the, municipal housewife is the next thing in order, and if the ward politician street superintendent is about to go on the garbage pile himself. T MENU TERMS So many foreign words are used nowadays in cook books and upon menus that it is almost ne cessary for everyone to know the meaning of the most common ones. This list of definitions may he of use to the housewife who has occasion to use her cook book frequently. Aspic A jelly made from meat stock and used as a, garnish. Bisque A shellfish soup. To Braise To cook meat in covered pan with heat applied both above and below. Compote Fruit stewed in sirup. Consomme A rich jellied soup. Chartreuse A preparation of meat, game or poultry moulded in jelly and surrounded by vegeta bles. Croquette Mixture of meat, fish or vegetables, warmed in cream, rolled, egged, breaded and fried in hot fat. Fillet Piece of solid meat or fish, sometimes skewered or-roll-ed. Glace Cover with icing. Glaze Soup boiled down in a paste. Grill To boil. Meringue Light puff of beat en white of egg and powdered sugar, delicately browned. Puree A thick soup pressed through a sieve.

    "HOUSEWIFE SETS AN EXAMPLE SHES GOING TO GET ALL SHE PAYS HER BUTCHER FOR Mrs. Jacksons Story. Evanston, 111., Feb. 6. When a woman pays for four and one half pounds of meat, can the butcher legally cut off and keep two pounds of trimmings and de liver only two and one-half pounds? Mrs. George P. Jackson of this city thinks not, and she is going to find out just what legal rights she has in the matter. Mrs. Jackson is the wife of a professor at the Northwestern Mrs. George P. Jackson. University. After she had seen the beef tenderloin weighing four and one-half pounds on the scales she ordered it larded as a fillet and sent to her home. When the meat was delivered the price remained $1.47, but the meat had shrunk to two and one half pounds. When Mrs. Jackson found she had paid 59 cents instead of 32 cents a pound for the fillet she had the butcher arrested. She produced in court the bill showing she had paid for four and one-half pounds, and produced also the two and one-half pounds of meat. The butcher dressed a tender loin before the judge, and showed a shrinkage of nearly 50 per cent. He declared THE CUSTOMER WOULD HAVE TO BEAR THE SHRINKAGE. Thats the custom, said the. butcher. The judge thought differently. He told Mrs. Jackson that he would have to discharge the pris oner, as he was only a clerk, and she should have the proprietor ar rested. This Mrs. Jackson is going to do and she has all the club women and housekeepers of Evanston back of her. It is time, she said, that women who are at all interested in the high cost of living should pay a little attention to getting what they pay for. By Idah McGlone Gibson. What Mrs. Jackson has done in Evanston should be done by every housewife in the country. This trimmings idea is one that has grown up with the breakfast food in boxes, the fruit canned in glass and other extravagant notions by which the maker and seller of these com modities can make up for short",

Out- HOUSEWIFE SHOULD0 door life, she says, hasmade her the model desired by well-known sculptors and painters. o o BITS OF INFORMATION Asa salutation to Emperor Yo shihito a number of school children recently marched to the imperial pa lace where, at a given signal, they released a swarm of fireflys, number ing about 10,000, which they had gathered and inclosed in tiny cages. William Fry Smith, age 9, of New ark, N. J., has a baby alligator, where until lately he had an alligator egg, sent to him by relatives in Florida. The boy has played with the egg con stantly since its arrival a week ago, and it is believed the warmth of his hands hatched the egg. J. J. Schoen of San Francisco, who ueft 13 children, bequeathed his whole estate, $26,000, to his widow. His will stated: I cut off my chil dren not for want of affection, but because there are so many of them that it would not be worth while to attempt to divide my estate among them. QO TO MARKET AND SELECT MEAT, SAYS WOMAN BUTCHER Cleveland, Oct 27. The average American housewife does not know how to get the most out of the meat she buys, says Miss Anna Bowden, Clevelands first woman butcher. The butcher bill would worry housewives less if they went in per son to the market, she says. Miss Bowden says when women DO go to market they trust to the butcher to give them the right cuts. A woman may say she wants meat for roasting and the butcher may give her long shoulder or round shoulder. When ifcame to roasting, the housewife would find the round shoulder, being the tougher, had not been roasted enough, or the long shoulder has been roasted too much. What is commonly called chuck, for roasting, is long shoulder. That is the part of beef close to the neck. Round shoulder, also a chuck, is more ttfward the forelegs and is more fatty. Both are good -when roasted. Round shoulder may also be tak en as steak, but it is the toughest of all steaks, and is best when roasted. Porterhouse may be too costly for the workingmans wife, but sirloin would make a good substitute, al though it is a bit tougher. Housewives should make use of meat bones in cooking soup. That puts flavor into soup and makes it more norishing. The best -soup meats, are the plate-piece, or breast rib meat, and the shank. Care should be taken that meat is fresh. Fresh meat is a strong red. When it ages it darkens. In pork the change is hardly noticeable. M iftMMMMMItftaft jsaaaatttfeMfc.tBl-liLiLt JflWlH",
    "CHICAGO WOMEN JOIN EGG STRIKE TO HIT FOOD GAMBLERS Chicago clubwomen are in sympa thy with Aid. George Pretzels sug gestion of an egg strike lasting dhe month. Pretzel believes that only in this manner can the price of eggs -be forced down. The alderman says he has received communications from .several organizations announcing jtheir co-operation. 1 have arranged with the women to call the strike immediately, said Pretzel. It will be an absolute boy cott This seems to be the only way of getting real action in a quick man ner. I have talked with Dist Atty Clyne and there seems to be no way of getting at the food hogs. Pretzel will talk to the womens organization of the 26th ward today on the, boycott Tomorrow the Po litical Equality league will hear the aldermans plans. In New York Commr John Dillon, head of the state dept of foods and markets Is urging an egg strike. If you cant get eggs for less than 35 cents a dozen, says Dillon, cut them out! Dillon, who is considered an au thority on the cost of living, believes the egg situation is one that the housewife- can attack with the hope of eetting results. In general, the housewife is as helpless as a babe in the woods! Dillon says. I dont say the situa tion is hopeless, but that the house wife alone is nearly helpless. The high price of eggs is an ex ception. Speculators put eggs into cold .storage last spring at about 22 cents a dozen. The cost of keeping them there ten months is only 2 cents. A wholesale price today of 28 cents would give an excellent profit The retail price should not be over 33 cents. Yet the actual price Is running all . the way TTom 45 to 60 .cents! tirte for eggs, and that is milk. The public doesnt appreciate that milk is the cheapest and best food we have. One quart of milk is worth eight fresh eggs in nutrient value. You can buy milk at from 8 to 10 cents a quart. Eight fresh eggs would cost you something like 50 cents. The housewife should substitute milk for eggs and use it in every way, for drinking and cooking. On the broader phases of the high cost of living, Commn Dillon said there is little opportunity for action on the part of the individual house wife. He proposed a state or municipal solution. The present crisis is only a more pronounced form of a permanent condition, he said. We always leave a few gamblers free to manipulate and speculate in the necessities of life. The solution will have to be a municipal system of food distribu tion.. Cities regulate distribution of water, gas and electric power. Why should they let the food supply go through the hands of irresponsible speculators? We must assemble the food sup ply of the whole city in one huge ter minal market with cold storage fa cilities. The city itself would own a small percentage of the supply of each. . commodity. Then suppose there was an attempt made to gouge the public, as is being done with eggs. The city at once would jump into the market and sell eggs at a fair profit If the city sold eggs at 33 cents, how long could retailers get 60 cents for them?
