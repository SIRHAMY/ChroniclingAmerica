	"mmmmgmmmmm mmSmmmw . jgt IF YOUR GROCER DOESNT SELL YOUkS, FRESH FOOD, GET A NEW GROCER, SAYS DR. WILEY By Dr. H. W. Wiley. It is all well enough to de scribe food adulteration and tell about the gasy methods for its de tection and to mention instances of gross misbranding. But if these things are mentioned only in an academic way they may serve to interest but not to pro tect. The practical point is how and where can the. housewife pro cure pure food, true to the name? First of all the housekeeper must depend upon her grocer. Grocers are sometimes abused and maligned, but it is doubtless true that they are as honest as the members of any other profession Most of them are reliable and.it is only the few who are dishonest. Let the housewife, study the char acter of her groder carefully. If he is not what he should be she can easily find someone who is. But it is not always necessary to change your grocer if he is found to be selling an adulterated article. He may be ignoraat of it himself and a word or a hint from the housewife may set him straight. In fact it may be said that every grocer who wishes to ) succeed in business, and, I sup pose that every one does, seeks to minister to the desires of his cus tomers and if they demand pure, wholesome and firstclass food he is very apt to give it to them. On the other hand, many groc ers sell adulterated, low grade products becatKetheirJcgslmeT want that kind of goods. An ef fort should be made to seggregate the bad business, in the hands of one set of grocers, from the good business in the hands of another. The housewife, then, has an easy method of making her choice. If a grocer persists in selling her bad articles there is only one course left for her to pursue an4 that is to withdraw her custom. In the second place the house wife should carefully study the problem of pure food. If she .buys fish she should ask the deal er how fresh it is, how long he has had it, if ityhas been frQzen and if this is the first time it has been exposed for sale. She should study its eyes and mouth to see if it is a freshly caught fish, or whether it has been frozen for one or more summers. A few in quiries of this kind and an in spection of the condition of the fish will warn the dealer that he need not offer any but the fresh article to that customer. The housewife should also study carefully into the grosser forms of adulteration and decep tion which are practiced in the so called package goods. They are apt to be too old. They are often mouldy and should always have careful inspection. . The grocer should be asked when they were packed and if they contain all the articles called for. I Package; goods are often put up wnto sizes to simulate, certain,",

Dont for get this. Baking Calumet Fo wderi Economy is the most important problem a housewife has to deal with in baking. Every housewife in the city of Rock Is land is studying methods of economy in these days of high cost of living. Calumet Bak ing Powder first insures won derful saving in . baking, but, it does even more than this it insures wholesome food, tasty food and uniformly rais ed food. The reason for this is very simple. The materials (BAKING POWDER)! or made by the 1 EUME1 in Calumet are so carefully selected and perfectly adapted to all baking, and then so scientifically proportioned that failures in baking are im possible. It is not economy when you buy the cheap or big can baking powder. When you buy Calumet, you , buy the highest quality. R eceived Highest Awards Calumet has received the HighestAward at the Worlds Pure Food Exposition, Chicago, 111., and at the Paris Exposition, France, March, 1912e Every housewife interested in reducing the High Cost of Living and in the use of pure baking powder is advised to write to the Calumet Baking Powder Co., 201 E. Ohio Street, Ch icago, for a beautifully illustrated cook book. This book contains 272 pages of valuable recipes and important information for the housewifes use.",

Id love to be a housewife! I would love to spend my day In a oozy little kitchen while the moments sped away! With the nicey, spicy odors, homey, and yet sharp and strange, And the genial warmth proceeding from the cun ning little range; With the mysteries of cooking and the knowl edge of the power To turn out a fresh creation of ones genius every hour; Oh, the drudgery of rhyming is a tame and thank less thing I should love to be a housewife that my very soul might sing! Id love to be a housewife! Making beds and sweeping floors Washing windows, if I chanced to need some ex ercise outdoors; Neer a fear of boss or foreman with its constant, prodding pain; Just the simple round of duty, with the mind at perfect rest. Thinking thoughts of love and beauty free, and giving forth its best; Oh, the world with all its worries is a falsehood and a snare And I fain would be a housewife, free from every earthly care! Would that I had been a housewife! Naught an noys her, year by year, But the tinner and the plumber when the bath rooms out of gear, And the grocer and the garbage and the babies and the rugs, And the garden and the furnace and the roaches and the bugs, And the neighbors with their gossip and the Ice man with his dirt, And a slouchy, grouchy husband with the but tons off his shirt Oh, Its fine to be a housewife, sheltered from the madding mob, (But a man that digs a sewer has a sweeter, easier job.)

	"Hi UNCLE 5An3 CHEESE BOOK FOR MRS. HOUSEWIFE (Editors note: Uncle Sam thinks we are not eating enough cheese. It is his idea that with more cheese on the family table we will wax richer in pnrse and fatter of body. The department of agriculture has prepared a cheese book, pointing out the value of cheese to the inner man, and giving many cheese dishes. These wilL appear from day to day in The Day Book under the title UncIe.Sams Cheese Book.It will pay you to cut them out each day and paste them in a small blank book for future refer 1 ence. By Uncle Sam. Cheese is used in general in two ways in small quantities chiefly for its flavor, and in large quantities for its nutritive value, as well as its flavor. Those which are used for their flavor, many of which are high priced, contribute little to the food value of the diet, because of the small quantity used at a time. They have an im portant part to play, however, in making the diet attractive and palatable. Those cheeses which are suit able to be eaten in large quanti ties and which are comparatively low priced, important for their flavor and nutritive value as well, are known to the trade ..stand ard factory cheese, and to the American housewife as American cheese. It is the regular, round cheese of the grocery store. This particular variety is referred to when the word cheese is used without specification in the reci pes to follow. Cheese has nearly twice as riiuch protein, weight for weight, as beef of average consumption and its fuel value is more than twice as great. It has a larger per cent of both, protein and fat than steak, eggs, potatoes, milk, or bread, and therefore is one of the very best foods that you can have on your table. Cheese does not cause constipaj tion or other physiological dis turbances that have erroneously, been charged to it. When cheese takes the place of meat as the central dish of a meal, the housewife should have fresh vegetables or fruits as a contrast to the concentrated and fatty cheese. Harder kinds of bread should be used, such as crusty rolls, toast, rye bread, the harder brown bread or crackers. CHEESE SAUCE One cupful of milk, 2 table spoonfuls of flour, 1 ounce of cheese ( cupful of grated cheese), salt and pepper. Thicken the milk with tKe floor",
	"it measures such as pounds, quarts, or pints. These packages bear no statement of weight or measure and probably are not sold by weight or measure, but they give an impression to the customerof a certain definite quantity. The housewife will gain great profit by inquiring just how much pack age goods she is receiving and she wijl often be surprised. The housewife should beware of the fluffy ruffles variety of foodJThere is a tendency to puff Up everything that is made to make it big in bulk while at the same time it is light in weight. Bottles are thicker than is neces sary for safety and the dent in the bottom sometimes extends alH most to the center. Cereal foods are flaked or rolled so as to ac cupy an immense bulk with light weight and while there may be no intention of deception there exists a general impression of re ceiving more than one gets. (Dr. Wiley will continue his talk to the housewife on market ing for pure, fresh, money worth foods in his article Mon day.) o o WEATHER REPORT JKain bunday hs& .bair tonight, fol lowed by unsettled weather and prob ably showers Sun day, for Chicago vicinity; no import ant change in tem perature ; moderate to brisk east erly winds, .  r fettled YOUNG GIRL CARING FOR TITANIC ORPHANS N New York, April 20. Two lit tle Titanic orphans, saved with a lap dog, and wholly uncon scious of the tragedy of their lives, are playing today at the home of Miss Margaret Hays. No one knows who they are, nor where their honie is. No ope knows if they have any living rel atives. They are just two little Waifs of the greatest sea disaster of history. The older is about four years old, a curlyhaired, brighteyed, little Frenchman, who spends most of his time trying to amqse his two year old companion. The other may be his brother, but no one knows for certain whether or no he is. Margaret Hays was saved on the last lifeboat to leave the Ti tanic. The boat had been lowered into the water, the crew were prepar ing to pull off, when a wild cry came from the deck of the sinking ship. A Frenchman, ,carrying two naked babies in his arms, ap peared at the rail. He shouted to the crew of the lifeboat, crying to them to save the babies ; then hurled the older one into the outstretched arms of a sailor. Wfth the tears streaming down his face, murmuring prayers, he hugged the younger baby to his breast, smothering its facewith a last farewell kiss. Then he tossed him, too, to safety.",
	"THE MUNICIPALHOUSEWIPET TT1 The stockyards at Chicago, with its 10 square miles of filthy yards and alleys and its streets half the time under water, was about the meanest proposition in the way of street cleaning ever offered a ward superintendent. It was clearly a job for a hardheaded, practical man who could deal firmly with rough necks and didnt mind bad smells. But Miss Anna Murphy, young and good looking, got the job. She has passed the civil service examination and there was no denying her. A good many people thought that was pushing the new woman idea just a trifle beyond the limit of common sense. Anna Murphy didnt think so. , She had a meager appropriation, but like a good housewife she made it go around. First she cleaned up the alleys, then white washed the fences, next established and strictly enforced .regulations to care for garbage. Finally she piled the refusefrom the alleys in the watersoaked streets, and had it covered with ashes and gravel before it was aware of it, and the stockyards district had a beauti ful new highway built without cost as anincident to cleaning up. the ward. Now Chicago is wondering if the, municipal housewife is the next thing in order, and if the ward politician street superintendent is about to go on the garbage pile himself. T MENU TERMS So many foreign words are used nowadays in cook books and upon menus that it is almost ne cessary for everyone to know the meaning of the most common ones. This list of definitions may he of use to the housewife who has occasion to use her cook book frequently. Aspic A jelly made from meat stock and used as a, garnish. Bisque A shellfish soup. To Braise To cook meat in covered pan with heat applied both above and below. Compote Fruit stewed in sirup. Consomme A rich jellied soup. Chartreuse A preparation of meat, game or poultry moulded in jelly and surrounded by vegeta bles. Croquette Mixture of meat, fish or vegetables, warmed in cream, rolled, egged, breaded and fried in hot fat. Fillet Piece of solid meat or fish, sometimes skewered orrolled. Glace Cover with icing. Glaze Soup boiled down in a paste. Grill To boil. Meringue Light puff of beat en white of egg and powdered sugar, delicately browned. Puree A thick soup pressed through a sieve.

	"HOUSEWIFE SETS AN EXAMPLE SHES GOING TO GET ALL SHE PAYS HER BUTCHER FOR Mrs. Jacksons Story. Evanston, 111., Feb. 6. When a woman pays for four and one half pounds of meat, can the butcher legally cut off and keep two pounds of trimmings and de liver only two and onehalf pounds? Mrs. George P. Jackson of this city thinks not, and she is going to find out just what legal rights she has in the matter. Mrs. Jackson is the wife of a professor at the Northwestern Mrs. George P. Jackson. University. After she had seen the beef tenderloin weighing four and onehalf pounds on the scales she ordered it larded as a fillet and sent to her home. When the meat was delivered the price remained $1.47, but the meat had shrunk to two and one half pounds. When Mrs. Jackson found she had paid 59 cents instead of 32 cents a pound for the fillet she had the butcher arrested. She produced in court the bill showing she had paid for four and onehalf pounds, and produced also the two and onehalf pounds of meat. The butcher dressed a tender loin before the judge, and showed a shrinkage of nearly 50 per cent. He declared THE CUSTOMER WOULD HAVE TO BEAR THE SHRINKAGE. Thats the custom, said the. butcher. The judge thought differently. He told Mrs. Jackson that he would have to discharge the pris oner, as he was only a clerk, and she should have the proprietor ar rested. This Mrs. Jackson is going to do and she has all the club women and housekeepers of Evanston back of her. It is time, she said, that women who are at all interested in the high cost of living should pay a little attention to getting what they pay for. By Idah McGlone Gibson. What Mrs. Jackson has done in Evanston should be done by every housewife in the country. This trimmings idea is one that has grown up with the breakfast food in boxes, the fruit canned in glass and other extravagant notions by which the maker and seller of these com modities can make up for short",

	"FARM LIFE MAKES HER CAPITOL MODEL NP OKSITTT Statues and paintings in the na tional capital bear the face and form of Mrs. Dorsett, daughter of a North Carolina mountaineer farmer. Out HOUSEWIFE SHOULD0 door life, she says, hasmade her the model desired by wellknown sculptors and painters. o o BITS OF INFORMATION Asa salutation to Emperor Yo shihito a number of school children recently marched to the imperial pa lace where, at a given signal, they released a swarm of fireflys, number ing about 10,000, which they had gathered and inclosed in tiny cages. William Fry Smith, age 9, of New ark, N. J., has a baby alligator, where until lately he had an alligator egg, sent to him by relatives in Florida. The boy has played with the egg con stantly since its arrival a week ago, and it is believed the warmth of his hands hatched the egg. J. J. Schoen of San Francisco, who ueft 13 children, bequeathed his whole estate, $26,000, to his widow. His will stated: I cut off my chil dren not for want of affection, but because there are so many of them that it would not be worth while to attempt to divide my estate among them. QO TO MARKET AND SELECT MEAT, SAYS WOMAN BUTCHER Cleveland, Oct 27. The average American housewife does not know how to get the most out of the meat she buys, says Miss Anna Bowden, Clevelands first woman butcher. The butcher bill would worry housewives less if they went in per son to the market, she says. Miss Bowden says when women DO go to market they trust to the butcher to give them the right cuts. A woman may say she wants meat for roasting and the butcher may give her long shoulder or round shoulder. When ifcame to roasting, the housewife would find the round shoulder, being the tougher, had not been roasted enough, or the long shoulder has been roasted too much. What is commonly called chuck, for roasting, is long shoulder. That is the part of beef close to the neck. Round shoulder, also a chuck, is more ttfward the forelegs and is more fatty. Both are good when roasted. Round shoulder may also be tak en as steak, but it is the toughest of all steaks, and is best when roasted. Porterhouse may be too costly for the workingmans wife, but sirloin would make a good substitute, al though it is a bit tougher. Housewives should make use of meat bones in cooking soup. That puts flavor into soup and makes it more norishing. The best soup meats, are the platepiece, or breast rib meat, and the shank. Care should be taken that meat is fresh. Fresh meat is a strong red. When it ages it darkens. In pork the change is hardly noticeable. M iftMMMMMItftaft jsaaaatttfeMfc.tBlliLiLt JflWlH",
	"CHICAGO WOMEN JOIN EGG STRIKE TO HIT FOOD GAMBLERS Chicago clubwomen are in sympa thy with Aid. George Pretzels sug gestion of an egg strike lasting dhe month. Pretzel believes that only in this manner can the price of eggs be forced down. The alderman says he has received communications from .several organizations announcing jtheir cooperation. 1 have arranged with the women to call the strike immediately, said Pretzel. It will be an absolute boy cott This seems to be the only way of getting real action in a quick man ner. I have talked with Dist Atty Clyne and there seems to be no way of getting at the food hogs. Pretzel will talk to the womens organization of the 26th ward today on the, boycott Tomorrow the Po litical Equality league will hear the aldermans plans. In New York Commr John Dillon, head of the state dept of foods and markets Is urging an egg strike. If you cant get eggs for less than 35 cents a dozen, says Dillon, cut them out! Dillon, who is considered an au thority on the cost of living, believes the egg situation is one that the housewife can attack with the hope of eetting results. In general, the housewife is as helpless as a babe in the woods! Dillon says. I dont say the situa tion is hopeless, but that the house wife alone is nearly helpless. The high price of eggs is an ex ception. Speculators put eggs into cold .storage last spring at about 22 cents a dozen. The cost of keeping them there ten months is only 2 cents. A wholesale price today of 28 cents would give an excellent profit The retail price should not be over 33 cents. Yet the actual price Is running all . the way TTom 45 to 60 .cents! tirte for eggs, and that is milk. The public doesnt appreciate that milk is the cheapest and best food we have. One quart of milk is worth eight fresh eggs in nutrient value. You can buy milk at from 8 to 10 cents a quart. Eight fresh eggs would cost you something like 50 cents. The housewife should substitute milk for eggs and use it in every way, for drinking and cooking. On the broader phases of the high cost of living, Commn Dillon said there is little opportunity for action on the part of the individual house wife. He proposed a state or municipal solution. The present crisis is only a more pronounced form of a permanent condition, he said. We always leave a few gamblers free to manipulate and speculate in the necessities of life. The solution will have to be a municipal system of food distribu tion.. Cities regulate distribution of water, gas and electric power. Why should they let the food supply go through the hands of irresponsible speculators? We must assemble the food sup ply of the whole city in one huge ter minal market with cold storage fa cilities. The city itself would own a small percentage of the supply of each. . commodity. Then suppose there was an attempt made to gouge the public, as is being done with eggs. The city at once would jump into the market and sell eggs at a fair profit If the city sold eggs at 33 cents, how long could retailers get 60 cents for them? Our cities buUd and maintain poorhouses, homes for the aged and for orphans, and charitable institu tions. Hunger and privation are fill ing these places.

	"In pursuance of a request from the Commercial Economy Board of the Council of National Defense, the Washington Master Bakers pledge them selves not to accept returns of ; unsold bread on and after JUNE 25, 1917 This action was taken upon the receipt of the following letter from the Commercial Economy Board: I:, vwk ?t & a COUNCIL OF NATIONAL DEFENSE. June 5, 1917. Gentlemen: In the present emergency, the importance of husbanding the wheat supply is such that all wastes of wheat, no matter how small, must be stopped. With this necessity in view, the Com mercial Economy Board has conducted an inquiry into the wholesale bakery practice of taking back unsold bread from retailers. The investigation covered representative bakeries in all parts of the United States. It appears that approximately 4 per cent of all the bread delivered by wholesale bakers is later returned to them, and that at least onethird of this is sold for animal feed. A portion of the bread returned is sold at reduced prices to charitable institutions and the poor. The Board points out, however, that with the cost of carrying this bread to and from the retailers elim inated, the baker could afford fully as well as now to sell the same amount of bread at the same re duced prices. With few exceptions, the bakers consulted agreed that the waste of labor and human food involved in the practice of accepting returns is detrimental to the public interest and should be discon tinued. This also is the conclusion of the Board and of the Council of National Defense. You are therefore hereby requested, in common with all other wholesale bakers, not to accept returns of unsold bread on June 25, and thereafter. COMMERCIAL ECONOMY BOARD OF THE COUNCIL OF. NATIONAL DEFENSE. i ... &. . vr v . t t .  & ! t   , . t r The bakers, however, cannot do this alone. . The housewife must cooperate with the baker and the grocer in order that this request be efficiently effective. WE MAKE THIS APPEAL TO THE HOUSEWIFE: Place Your Order tor Bread a Day in Advance This will not only assure the grocer of your daily requirements, but will also eliminate the return of unsold bread to the baker. We trust thai we may have a prompt demonstration from the housewives of Washington of their desire to serve our country in this a grave national necessity.",

Dressed in the height of fashion, with feathers, velvet and tulle, Mrs. American Housewife forcefully took a hand in the administrations antitrust pro gram and demanded a hearing from the House judiciary committee, pleading that woman buyers at the small corner grocery and large de partment stores be considered by the president and congress in framing antitrust bills. The woman was Mrs. Christine Frederick of Philadelphia, represent ing the Housewives League of Amer ica. She was given profound atten tion by the committee, as she de manded that pending antitrust bills abolish cutthroat cut price com petition. Bargain counter scrambles was described by Mrs. Fredericks. She said that cut prices on standard arti cles were used by dealers as a lure, a bait and a snare to get women to stores that they might be stung on other extortionatelypriced articles. On one occasion, she said, I crowded around a bargain counter, hadmy plexls torsus twisted out of shape, suffered a dislocation of my dorsal humberis, wrecked my best hat, tore out the armhole of a good waist, and secured three yards of Valenciennes lace for which I paid only 78 cents. . Competition without pricecutting will work out the salvation of busi ness with Uncle Sam an umpire. What women want is the fullest and frankest knowledge .about every article they buy; the ability to send a child or servant to. buy any article without fear of overcharge, or that the price or quality will be different.",

	"pursuance of a request from the Commercial Economy Board of the Council of National Defense, the Richmond Master Bakers pledge themselves not to accept returns of unsold bread on and after JUNE 26, This action was taken upon the receipt of the following letter from the Commercial Economy Board: COUNCIL OF NATIONAL DEFENSE. June 5, 1917. Gentlemen: In the present emergency, the importance of husbanding the wheat supply is such that all wastes of wheat, no matter how small, must be stopped. With this necessity in view, the Commercial Economy Board has conducted an inquiry into the wholesale bakery practice of taking back unsold bread from retailers. The investigation covered representative bakeries in all parts of the United States. It appears that approximately 4 per cent of all the bread delivered by wholesale bakers is later returned to them, and that at least onethird of this is sold for animal feed. A portion of the bread returned s sold at reduced prices to charitable institutions and the poor. The Board points out, however, that with the cost of carrying this bread to and from the retailers eliminated, the baker could afford fully as well as now to sell the same amount of bread at the same reduced prices. With few exceptions, the bakers consulted agreed that the waste of labor and human food involved in the practice of accepting returns is detrimental to the public interest and should be discontinued. This also is the conclusion of the Board and of the Council of National Defense. You are therefore hereby requested, in common with all other wholesale bakers, not to accept returns of unsold bread on June 26 and thereafter. COMMERCIAL ECONOMY BOARD OF THE COUNCIL OF NATIONAL DEFENSE. The bakers, however, cannot do this alone. The housewife must cooperate with the baker and the grocer in order that this request be efficiently effective. WE MAKE THIS APPEAL TO THE HOUSEWIFE: Place Your Order tor Bread a Day in Advance This will not only assure the grocer of your daily requirements, but will also eliminate the return of unsold bread to the baker. We trust that we may have a promp demonstration from the housewives of Richmond of their desire to serve our country in this, a grave national necessity. CORBY BAKING COMPANY, Inc.

Thirty rinses a minute in clear soft water and suds of pure white soap is the superior means by which we, in our modern laundry, achieve such results.

A woman slipped on the skin of a specimen of that succulent fruit at one of the other markets and obtained a ver djct against the city for damages.

PJjBBBBBKyaBBBBBBHhBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBr ?! 3S?P9BbBbBBBBbH lllilllHHBlHilllllllKiKIIIH Its Thoroughfares Teem With Thrifty Marketers 3 ears the women of the Northeast Section have been obliged 1o deal with retailers or middlemen instead of buying direct from the farmer. This has necessitated the paying of an extra profit, over and above the price of the farmer, to these retailers. nw this right of the farmer to bring the results of his toil direct to the housewife is restored. It should be a matter of great rejoicing to the thousands of women who run the homes of V aihington especially in the Northeast Section. As everyone knows the elimination of the middleman makes for lower prices. The new arrangement of Northeast Market, with its covered booths of the many farmers and produce raisers markets does just this. Eliminates the Middleman Conditions permitting the sale of vegetables, dairy products, eggs poultn, etc., direct from the farmer who ib the producer to the housewife who is the consumer, makes for economy and loner prices. When the farmer can sell his products on the cit curbstone direct to the women of the Capital he has but one price. When these products pas through the hands of a middleman or retailer an additional profit over and above the farmers original price must be paid by the consumer. In many instances products which can now be bought direct from the farmer have heretofore had to pass through the hands of several such middlemen, each one adding his own profit, until it is small wonder that the housewife has been dismayed at the increasing high cost of living. Under the restored conditions which now maintain at the Northeast Market the products of the rich fields of Virginia and Maryland are brought right to the consumer without any middle man adding a cent to the cost. Eggs, fresh from the chicken houses, spinach, new potatoes, corn, tomatoes, home dressed meats, country butter, and the hundred and one toothsome and necessary foods of the farms are brought to the housewife at a single cost the price the farmer has earned for raising them. Another most important advantage that the housewife gains by patronizing the farmers and stalls of the Northeast Market is that of having her products absolutely fresh. Two Hours From Country to Kitchen Crisp, fresh vegetables with the morning dew still shining on them are displayed in pro fusion. In baskets and boxes, in wagons and stalls, on the curb and inside the market the greatest variety of choice fresh vegetables and fruits, with all of the zest that only absolute freshness can impart are arrayed at temptingly low prices for the women of the homes to pick and choose. This is recognized as both a morning and evening market. The wagons and baskets, crates and boxes laden with the choicest products of the fertile farms of Maryland and Virginia crowd the entire market place with their profusion. The pleasing aroma of fresh cut fruits and vegetables the smell of the real country hovers over the place and makes marketing a real pleasure aside from its more utilitarian idea of economy. The farmers bring their products straight from the fields and orchards direct to the market where the women can select them. The result is in many instances that but a few hours elapse betwen the time when the produce was picked and the time when it is ready for the table. Indeed the Northeast Market places the whole of the surrounding farm district right at the door, of the thrifty housekeeper. It is her garden patch where she can cull the choicest fruits and vegetables almost at first hand. Before she rises in the morn ing the farmer and raiser of country produce has been up, aroused by the crowing of the cock, and busied himself with cutting and plucking his produce in the wee sma  hours of the morning and has brought it in, eight or ten miles, to the city. This dependable freshness is an element which cannot be bbbbbbbbWKSI! IgfcirBl  jBBBfiNEPflBBBKi ABBHBBBBBBBBBa feMSKM. BBtXlra MBBBBBBBBBB overestimated. The modern housewife is exceedingly partic ular as to the quality of the food she serves her family. She wants the best while it is at its best and she gets it at the North east Market. Perfect Cleanliness Absolutely sanitary conditions and perfect cleanliness mark this model market inside and out. Daily the health inspectors visit it and they willingly admit that there is not another market in the whole city of Washington which surpasses it in cleanliness. Inside the spacious stalls with their white tile fronts show at a glance that there is not a speck of dirt that can mar the taste, smell, or purity of the products. The pictures give a faint idea of the invitingly clean appearance of the market inside and out. wvmmjrmtr Many Modern Improvements The Northeast Market has done everything to encourage the farmers with their produce who attend the market Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Every facility for the proper display and protection of the foodstuffs is offered them.

There they had built up a clientele of steady trade that they had to forsake in coming to the Northeast Market, yet many of them claim that they are here doing double the business they did elsewhere. The housewives appreciation is best demonstrated by the pictures. Foods Protected From the Suns Glare By Awnings A permanent awning has been erected which protects both the purchaser and the products from the glare of the sun and inclement weather. Many extensive improvements have been made in the market, among which is the removal of the wood benches and the installation of sanitary white tile stands. As will be noted further, the white tile refrigerator, only one in the cit, is at the Butter and Creamery Stand. The company has ",
	"A10 News of the Mines and Oil Fields COPPER MARKET YET UNSETTLED GENTLEMENS AGREEMENT WILL NEVER BE REACHED EIGHT.CENT PRODUCERS STAND IN WAY Grant Sees in Situation Only Dlsapj pointment for Small Producer Should Issue Carry—No Merger Probable The socalled gentlemens agreement between copper producers now being discussed in New York with a view to regulating the market for the metal will never become effective according to Robert ]>. Grant, president of the American Mines and Exploration com pany, who has Just returned to Los Angelas after spending four months in the east. Mr. Grant and his asso ciate, Philip Wiseman, promoted the Ray Consolluated ami Gila Copper properties in Arizona, and recently dis posed of their interests for a sum in excess of $1,000,000 cash in a private sale to Bernard M. BaniCß of New York. Regarding the copper situation, said Mr. Grant yesterday, I do not look for a combination of Senator w. A Clark, PhelpsDodga and the Calu met and Hecla as going into any merger. , As for the socalled gentlemens agreement as discussed In New York, such a proposition would not carry for the reason that a producer of the metal around 8 cents laid down in New York would not feel like curtail ing in order to help out the other fel low whoso cost was around 11 cents a pound. 5 Decision Affect* Plans There were all kinds of««tor1< go Ing about in New York concerning the merger and who would go Into It and upon what basis, but the recent decis lon against the Standard Oil changed a good many plans among: the copper people who were trying to get together. There Is at the present time quite a large copper surplus and all the mines seem to be working to nearly full ca pacity. The consumer Is buying only from one to two months ahead, M It would seem that there must come be fore long come kind of a combination by which production of the metal can be regulated. Every business bark east peetni bet ter and healthier, excepting the copper business, which I think Is due to the new porphyry properties sending Into the market a lot Ofcopper at low cost in addition to a very large output from the old mine.. We have nil been disappointed that »the railroads have not gone ahead with the electrification of their lines as planned several years ngo. This advancement has been held up by panic, but as business improves electrical power will no doubt be util ized by most eastern railroads. When this change la finally made the pur plus of copper will be quickly wiped out. While enst Mr. Ornnt and family toured all through New York nnd the New England states In his automo bile. The country there. Is very beauti ful In the autumn, says Mr. Grant, but no place looked half .1 good as Los Angeles and we are all mighty glad to get back. One hears a great deal of favor able talk In the east about Southern California and especially this city, and this winter should witness a large In flux of visitors from that part of the nation.

	"Penny Pinching Not Always True Economy The housewife schooled in really scientific domestic economy no longer throws away a nickel to save a penny. A good way to illustrate this would be through a comparison of the wholesome ness, efficiency and economy of a plain flour and a standard baking powder and a socalled self rising flour. It doesnt pay to buy selfrising flour. Most of it is made, of low grade materials. It causes many bakeday failures and a great loss of expensive baking ingredients. x The housewife will throw out in wasted materials many times the amount she hopes to save. Beside, self rising flour has a tendency to get lumpy and thats another waste. But what is most important, the housewife gets less in return as far as food value is concerned than if she purchased a plain flour and a standard baking powder. ; True economy in baking powder de mands the highest quality at the lowest price. A Baking Powder made only of the highest class ingredients obtainable, so skillfully and accurately proportioned that it not only pro duces the maximum of leavening power but conserves that power, retains its strength and is unfailing in results, is economical in cost and use. The housewife saves when she buys it. She saves when she uses it and she saves the materials with which it is used. That is economy in its highest form the only kind of economy the housewife should attempt to practice. American Red Cross Dietitian.

	"FIRE INSURANCE REPORT. Wo have received from the National board of fire underwriters of New York tho report for December, 1009, of insurance conditions in Salt Lake City. This report is decidedly not flattering from ilia insurance standpoint; but it must bo remembered I hat. tho data and the criticisms are based upon any lapse from a perfect condition, and as Salt Lake City is not. perfect from tho fire insurance standpoint, the criticism is, as largely expected, routine. Thero is ample water,, to bo sure, and for Hho most part the hydrants are sufficiently largo and numerous, especially in the business part of town; and yet the tiro eouipment is not. fully up to dale nor in quantity as much as tho insuranco perfection requires. The forco is criti cised somewhat from tho political standpoint:; which is more academic than . actual; and thoro is declared to be an insutncioul number of men, which is no doubt true from tho standard of perfection standpoint of tho insurance companies. There is pretty severe censure of our fire box system, but that censure is based on a condition of neglect which existed in the early pari, of tho sum mer, and which has been corrected since, but; wo depend principal ly on tho telephono for firo alarms, so tho disuse of tho tiroalarm boxes is not so ma terial. But tho correction should have been noted instead of allowing tho roport of tho original bad condition to stand unrelieved. In tho general sum mar, tho water situation and its man agement, aro pronounced efficient and generally satisfactory. Tho firo ap paratus is pronouueed generally in good condition, but in minor equipment de ficient. Tho inspection is fairly satis factory, but tho building laws are of littlo value, most subjects of import ance being omitted. which is rathor a startling thing to say and unfair, as a matter of fact, to tho ordinanco as passed. Additional condemnation is made by saving structural conditions aro unsatisfactory on account of poor building laws. It is further stated that no provision is mado for prose cution of arson, which is nonsenso. Tho general statute is ample for such prosecution, and thero could bo no municipal ordinance that would reach the case. Any expectation based on the idea that prosecution for arson could bo conducted under city ordin ances is erroneous. The general effoct of tho report is rather confusing on tho whole, unless wo keep strictly in mind the idea ihat this report is made from the stand point of idoal insuranco conditions un der which fire is practically impos sible, and in which case, of course, there need bo no bother about insuring at all. The ideal condition from tho fire insuranco standpoint would neces sarily defeat its own cause, for if wo had it nobody need bother about insur ing anjthing. At the same time that there is much criticism of tho city from the lire in surance standpoint, thero is an admis sion of general results hero which is certainly very satisfactory, and miti gates almost entirely the force of tho criticism. The report sa3s (on tho soc ond page): The prross fire loss for the past five years, as Klven in tho reports of the chief of the lire department, amounted to S3S4.78G, the annual losses varying from ?1.11 In 1304, to $132,303 In 1007. and the number of fires from 187 In 1901, to 321 In 1008. Tho loss per fire has averaged 5321. and the yearly number of firoa 240. Based on an average population of 72,000. tho average number of fires per year for each 1,000 population was 3.32, and the average annual loss per capita $1.07, a low figure. With resulls like that, the insurance companies ought certainly to bo con tent, especially when wo consider the probability (the segregation of tho city premiums paid from thoso paid ;u the state at largo not being required by law) that they undoubtedly receive iroble (and perhaps more) tho amount of money in premiums over the total amount of firo losses. So that on tho whole, even from tho insuranco stand point, thn city of Salt Lake ought to be considered qn the average a mighty good fire risk. FULL CORROBORATION. During tho courso of the controversy between this paper and the Doserct News over tho assassination of Joseph and Ilyrum Smith, wo at ono time print ed part of a statement mado by Cath erine1 Smith, who was a sister of the two murdored men. Wc now havo that statement in fuller form, tho addi tional matter having been inacccsiblo lo us upon tho former occasion. As a means of more fully informing tho pub lic in this matter, wo reproduce this more complete statement, as follows: I was In Nauvoo a few days before my brothers were brought to Carthagu, where they met their death. I shall never for pet that Saturday, June 23, 1811, when I last saw my brothers alive. Joseph had preached a sermon lo tho largest crowd I have ever scon. It was his last sermon.1 1 might say. that It was more In the nature of a prophecy than a ser mon, for ho said, turning on the plat form where he stood and facing some of thr high prlosts and elders sitting there: There arc those among you who will betray mo soon; In fact, you have plot ted to deliver mo up to thn enemy lo be slain. Tho truth of this prophecy Is of history. Ho was betrayed, and by his own alleged best friends. Theso same fellows attempted to assume the reins of the church at his death. They not only attempted this, but thoy attempt ed to Introduce obnoxious teachings into tho church. My ncphow, the present Jo seph Smith, president of tho Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints at La monl, Iowa, Is the truo and only succes sor of Joseph Smith, tho martyr. It is unnecessary to mnko comment upon this matter; and it is morely pre sented lo further prove our contention that it was plotting and intrigue among tho Mormon priesthood , that brought about the death of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, just as wohavo all along contended, and proved by the best au thorities, and which contpntion tho Deseret News has persistently denied. As to who was entitled to lead tho church after tho death of the Smiths is none of? our concern, but is a matter to be decided between the contending factions themselves upon personal be lief. And yet it may be well, oven upon this matter, to refer to Whitneys His tory of Utah, because, possibly, the question of leadership may havo played a part in tho conspiracy to removo Joseph. In volume 1, on page U32, that work says: Of tho nbsent. Apostles. Parley P. Pratt was tho first to return to Nauvoo. Ueorgn A. Smith came next. Sidney P.lgdon ar rived a little later from Pittsburg. Brig ham Young, Hobcr C. Kimball, Orson Ilvde, Orjon Pratt. Wilford Woodruff arid Lyman Wight, who woro in tho Eastern States when tho tcrrlblo tidings reached them, returned to Nauvoo on the Uth of August, forty days after the massacre. Immediately aflcr this scramble for home ihero was a hot row on among all tho leading men of tho church, and be tween factions of tho saints themselves, as to who was to gel. the plum of lead ership. Plots and counterplots wore laid and executed. The community was  rent  with strife and un rest and .uncertainty pervaded the homes of tho people. But in the end Brigham executed a coup detat that completely shut out his ecclesias tical competitors. As tho head of the twelvo ho called a meeting in tho Nauvoo temple, stationed a lot of his supporters out in tho audience, and be gan, an impassioned speech. When the people were worked tip lo a high pitch of excitement his emissaries slolo quiet ly to ono and tho other, saying, Look! tho mantlo of Joseph has fallen upon Brigham! Dont you see? Thero is Joseph back again! Brigham is our leader! And Brigham won out. RAYNERS HOT ROAST. Sonator Rayncr has administored to Zela3a a roast about as hot as any which history records against a de generate ruler. TC ho were simpty a highwayman, says Senator Kayncr, wo might identify him; if ho were simply a tyrant, who oppressed the peo ple for tho purposo of robbing them, wo might particularizo him; if ho were a usurpor, who was only holding onto power so long as there was jlny money in tho treasury to stoal, orany further territory that ho could sack for private plunder, we could assign him a proper placo in tho ranks of somo of his prede cessors, and if ho were purely an as sassin, who regarded murder as a legiti mate profession through which he could despoil his victims of their possessions until the time came for him to flee from the hands of rctributivo ;justieo, it would bo easy also for anyone ac quainted with the political history of Nicaragua lo classify him. Ho is, however, all of theso things combined1. In the school of corruption, dishonor, perfidy and crime ho stands without a peer, and exhibits in ono glow of associated harmony the pride of every model and tho perfection of every master. And Mr. Rayner conliuucs that ho has been roliably informed. .that, .tho vices of his private lifo arc moro in famous in their indescribable dolails than tho iniquities of his public ca reer. Justly, therefore, he concludes that such a creature as this desorves the oxecration of mankind. Applying tho arraignment mado to the caso in hand Senator Raynor said: Now. as the culminating infamy of his administration, trampling upon every In stinct of humanity. In violation of univer sal law, In defiance of those precepts of the International code that havo been rec ognized ever since tho night of barbarism receded before the rays of civilization, ho has put to torture and then to death two American citizens who were not guilty of treason, who woro not spies, but whom ho had captured as prisoners of war In the army of the revolutionists. This act was not only tho act of a fiend, but was an Insult to tho honor of this republic, and cannot remain una venged. It Is absolutely preposterous for us to talk about Indemnity. Indemnity Is in recompense for murder. It Is said we ought to break off official communication with his accredited representatives. Wo have already done that and that amounts to nothing and Is a matter of absolute unconcern to him. Then It Is said wo ought (o declare war against Nicaragua. 1 think that Is unnecessary. This government Is a cowardly govern ment If It docs not make an example of Zelnya before the eyes of the civilized world. This case will not admit of any trilling or concessions. If two American citizens havo been murdered by Zelnya, then he must bo made lo pay tho pen alty of his crime. Once spread before tho American peo ple the details of the execution and our people will rise In arms and demand retri bution. They have not yet fully absorbed the significance of this deed. All of which is mighty vigorous talk, decidedly stirring to tho Amorican heart. And yet tho question must nat urall ariso, what; interest, the United Slates has in its allogcd citizens who enter the service of somo foreign power and meet their death either barbarously or othcrwjso while in that service. If wc extend the protection of our citi zenship to persons who havo abjured that citizenship by entering tho scrvico of other nations, or of thoao who would obtain powor in othor nations by insur rection or treason, than that is a prin ciple that is to bo onforcodnoL only as against Nicaragua, but as against any other nation or power. And if it is good international law, aro wo pre pared to enforce it, say against. Great Britain, Prance, German, or Russia? If wo aro, all right. If wo aro not, do not lot us mako bombastic bullies of ourselves by assorting it against weak and puny Nicaragua, when wo would not assert it agninst another nntion, ono of our own size. THE INTOLERANT SPIRIT. Wo vory often hear from the Deseret News concerning the spirit of tolerance that was exercised toward inhabitants of this valley when tho Mormon lead ers were in complotc control hero. Let us cito an cxamplo of it. Wc find it; in a sermon delivered by President Brigham Young at the timo tho south cast corner stono of tho Salt. Lake tem ple was laid and dedicated. It is in tho Journal of Discourses, volumo 2, pago 33, and roads as follows: We do not wnnL any whlnors about this temple. If you cannot commence cheerfully, and go through tho labor of the whole building choerfully, start for California, and tho quicker tho better. Heretofore wo havo quoted tho un polile invitations extended to Gentiles and apostates, by Prosident Young and llebor C. Kimball, that if thoy did not like I he oneman domination that ex isted hero, or objected to the manner in which things wore run, they could get out, and do it allfired quick. And hero, now, wo see (hat the same spirit of intolerance wns exhibited to ward even the Mormon poople, pro vided any of thorn disliked to bo im poverished for the purposo of construct ing an edifice in which thoy could be mado io swear vongeanco against, the United States, and submit themselves lo an agreement lo suffer the most cruel tortures and death in the evonl IhnL they divulged tho secrets thorcin confided to their keeping. Between ono thing and nnothor, it was a rathor jolly lifo that both Gen tiles und Mormons led horc in tho early days; and it goes without saying that if the power were possessed by tho presentday hierarchs the danco would be proceeding at a still livelier paco today. THE RULE OF THE ROAD. Tho Tribuno has been frequent in urging the rulo that persons mooting on the sidewalks should always turn to the right. This for tho purpose of convenience, uniformity, and to pre vent confusion and collisions. A cor respondent calls attention to this, and asks us to explain on that basis tho following despatch from Paris which appoarod in tho New York Timos: PARIS. Nov. 19 Pending tho time whon special njotor roads aro expeeied to form a network over Franee, a Par liamentary committee is busy drawing up a rulo of the road for tho country. Each Department hitherto has seemed to possess Its own rule, while In Paris no rulo is observed or enforced at all meeting vehlelos turning to tho right or left as Is most convenient for them. Tho plan of the committee Is to adopt the English system of keeping to tho left. This plan, which, as Americans will on sorve. Is the opposite of the rule fol lowed In tho United States, has tho ap proval of M. Millcrand, the Minister ot Public Works. Arguments In favor of the ICeop to tho Left rulo take the following shape: Tho English rule of proceeding to the left Is founded upon logic and good sense, and Is the result of tho experi ence of a pcoplo habituated to horses. The fact that a driver keeps to the left of Ih road and yet sits over the right wheel of his vehicle gives him a belter chance of steering, with a wider margin of safety, than the man who keeps to the right, and cannot. In conscouenco. gee how far oft he Is from Ills neighbors wheel. The advantago Is, also, to the English system In passing to the offside of a vehicle. Tho Keep to the Right style Is condemned because of tho dan ger to which It exposes the man who Is leading a horse. Tho driver of tho fast moving vehicle Is unable to see the man on foot until ho is right upon him. There havo been a large number of fatal acci dents for tills very reason on French roads. Meanwhile, It would bo Interesting to learn Just how tho Keep to the Right rule camo to bo established In the United States. Wns It Invented by tho colonists or did It becomo tho fashion as a sort of autlBrltlsh demonstration at tho time of the American Hovoltulon? Tho correspondent will note that tho Paris despatch noted refers to tho rule of tho road in driving horses or motor vohiclcs. It is, as staled, an awkward thing for thoso sitting on tho right and meeting a vehicle on tho rond to turn lo the right. Tho natural thing is for them to turn to the left, so that the driver can tho moro clearly seo tho spaco between his own vohiclo and tho ono he is meeting. This should havo been tho rulo in this country as well as in England. But tho rule of tho road for pedestrians is tho re verse of that for vehicles. Tho colon ists to this country from Groat Britain brought with them the rulo of tho pedes trian, which is to turn to the right. This from immemorial usage. Corre spondingly, they ought to havo brought with them the rule to turn to the left in driving, but thoy did not. On tho contrary, they seemed to consider that tho same rulo should apply to driving as to walking. It docs hot logically ap ply at all. Quito tho roverse. It would bo better if wo had hero a rulo to turn to tho left in driving all kinds of vehi cles, including automobiles. It is too lato now, however, to undertake to chaugo that tuIc. In France, as noted in tho despatch, thoro is great confusion, ono province followiug the one rulo and another tho other rule. In Paris thero is no rulo at. all. Tu seeking uniformity, there fore, the French authorities aro natural ly and logically following the rulo to tho left, in driving vehicles. Wo should bo glad if that custom had boon trans mitted to us from Great Britain. It is logical, convenient, and in every way reasonable. But wo dont havo it; and anjhow it has nothing to do with tho rule of pedestrians, which is in Eng land, as horc, to turn to tho right, and that is whufcwo aro endeavoring to iu culcato on our sidewalks. It is tho rule of gonoral application for those who walk, and it ought lo bo observed by ovorybody. Tho pedestrian in old times carried his shield on his left arm, and it was, a dofonse when ho walked in placo to tho right; but if ho wero bent on attack ho moved lo tho loft, so as to givo play to his right arm. Cor respondingly, the knightly horsoman was a man of war, always belligerent, and was bound to pass to tho left, in ordor to givo play to his lance. And tho men of war, whether afoot or on horsoback, laid down the law. It is observed that tho Dcsorot News prints a long editorial article on tho subject of denatured alcohol. Certain exports in criminology might sug gest to Cho church organ the pertinence of a pious dissertation upon the sub ject of denatured polygamies. A reported jewelry theft ih New York seems to bo regarded by tho police in the samo light as tho story of the man who blows his wnges and then ( tolls his wifo ho wns hold up. It is not so much that the small bpy dislikes school, ot course, as it is that ho has heard so much about so many great men having started out in lifo without education.

	"Another household problem solved City life did away with the family cow always concerned us. It has been a long time since households had to be selfsufftcient?since housewives had to weave their own cloth and churn their own butter. Progress has simplified the problems of house keeping. It has contribuied as much in comfort and convenience to the home as it has contributed in speed and efficiency to business. Many of the old problems were outgrown, or solved for all time. But throughout all the stages of our advancing life there has been one problem never entirely solved. The milk problem has From the days when Old Bossy, the family cow, was considered the only reliable source of the household milk supply we have sought the purest milk obtainable. Housewives especially have always been watchful of the purity of the milk supply, because on it depended largely the health of their families. But the circumstances of city life eliminated Old Bossy and with it, for most women, the drudgery of milking. Progress necessitated a new means of providing our milk sup? ply, and we came to depend on the milkman. It did not take long for the development of an intri cate system of milk transportation and distribution. No one questioned the excellence of the arrangement until the whole system became demoralized by irregular deliveries, labor troubles Krystalak eliminates the need and exorbitant costs. for daily milk deliveries It was not a case of finding a substitute tor milk. The trouble was not that the original cost of production of milk had risen so greatly, but that the huge bulk of fluid milk made it too expensive _o transport and handle in this day of high costs. Another difficulty was the great need of re frigeration and for quick distribution. j^i(|^j|y .1 ??1? I Then, as often happens in the field of science, this discovery was found to possess further benefits?advantages un dreamed of when the idea of Krystalak was conceived. Its many excellencies have been summed up very concisely by the U. S. Govern? ment in one of its booklets as follows: (1) Increased digestibility (2) Bacterial purity (3) Keeping qualities? no ice needed (4) Convenience?always ready (5) Palatability (6) Cheapness?no water (7) Transportation advantages?small bulk, does not freeze You can keep a supply on hand Anybody with judgment can understand the scientific and economic advantages of Krystalaks qualities, but only a housewife can appreciate how they simplify her problems in the household. What housekeeper has not had the experience of nnding that the milk has not been delivered in time for breakfast?or of discovering in the middle of baking that she has exhausted her supply ! And yet, who can afford to keep .a large sup? ply of fresh milk on hand just in case of emergency? Fluid milk costs too much and spoils too quickly. But with Krystalak there are no milk emergencies. You order it from your grocer along with other staples and you can always keep a few boxes ahead?a veritable reservoir of milk. You mix Krystalak, fresh from the box, in the exact quantity you need, by simply adding water. One great contribution is economy conquer space, * distance, tempera and time would have been im The fresh for science. changing pure, i V . K To ture possible except solution lay in milks form ? reducing its transporta tion costs ? removing that bacteria which necessitated refrigeration and daily delivery. The process was invented ? im proved and per fected. Today pure, fresh milk, ata factory situated right in the dairy dis? trict, has the fat removed from it, so that it will keep, and all the water dried out, so that its bulk is only onefifth that of fluid milk. The result is milk in the form of dry, sparkling, white crystals?KRYSTALAK. bulk to cut ____&____ Krystalak is made in the heart of the dairy district THE DOv un _? J**?^ i. ... NEWVORK But perhaps the greatest contribution science gave to the housewife in Krystalak is its economy. It furnishes you with milk at 10c a quart and saves still more by not requiring ice and never spoiling. After all, though, the test that, in the housewifes eyes, is more im? portant than any scientific test is the test of its results in cooking. Here it excels because of the very qualities we have emphasized before ?its purity, its uniformity, its freshness. a Cream soups, cream sauces, puddings, cakes, ;j muffins, chocolate and cocoa made with Krys? talak are both delicious and economical. But the surest and most satisfactory and, after all, the only way to learn the real worth of Krystalak, is to try it. Your grocer has it?packed in sani tary, water tight, blue striped pack ages. A package costs 50c and with it you can make 5 full quarts of milk ? 10c a quart. Its uniformity and purhy insure wonderful results KRYSTALAK ^Better fbrcoo&ing than fluid milk",
	"CLOSE RACE BY THREE PARTIES White River Junction, Sept. 4.— The close race between.three parties republican, democratic and progres sive, in yesterdays election, was em phasized today in the revision of re turns of the vote for governor. The revised returns from all but thireyone small towns in the state are as follows: Allen N. Fletcher, republican, 28, 599. Harian B. Howe, democrat, 18,464. Rev. Fraser Metzger, progressive, 14,204. Clement F. Smith, prohibitionist, 1,429. Fred W. Shiter, socialist, 1,110. Failure of the republican candidate for governor to obtain a majority for the first time in the history of the state in an election preceding a presi dential election will necessitate the election of a states chief executive by the elgislature. It is expected the republicans will have a substantial majority in the legislature, although there are nearly eightyone towns yet to report on the vote for representa tives. The strength of the progressive vote was the feature of the election. Democrat? also increased their vote over two years ago. The falling off in the republican vote was wfAfj, Indications were that a great part of thedefeetion went to the progressives, although the democrats also gained And a few of the republicans went to the prohibitionist ticket.

COOMBS WITHDRAWS Valley City, N. D., Aug. 30.—Lee Coombs today issued an official an nouncement that he will withdraw from the race for Judge of the Fifth judicial district, leaving the Add to Judge Coffey, who will now have no opposition for reelection. This means that the election of Judge Cof fey will be mere formality at the polls in November. Mr. Coombs issued the following statement of withdrawal: To the people of the Fifth judicial district, state of North Dakota: After a careful resume of the re isult of the primary election held June 26, 1912, in so far as the same re lates to the judiciary, I have concludi ed that Judge James A. Coffey of Jamestown, is the choice of the ma jority of the voters of the district for the judgship, and, therefore, think it my duty to withdraw from the con test. I ascribe Judge Coffeys lead over me at the primaries to his incum brency and the claim of himself and 1 his friends for a second term. I do not consider the result as an expres sion of lack of confidence on the part of the people in me, or as a rebuke to my aspiration for the place. I thank the voters of Valley City and of the entire district for the sup port given me at the primary election, and I trust that should opportunity arise in the future we shall be able) to unite on some member of the pro fession of the law who resides here and elect him as judge of the dis trict, since I believe that to have the ^district chambers at Valley City would be far better for all interested, than to have them located at some other city in the district.

THE JOLLY MERCHANT JOLLIES THE CLERK. THE JOLLY CLERK JOLLIES THE PUBLIC. And the jolly public jollies the whole jolly bunch by footing the jolly bills, and everybodys brimming over with jolly and you jolly well know it. Hence you see that business is a continuous jolly. With something at the back of it to make it successful, and that something is—MERIT. Yes! We are going to give you a little talk about the Crescent Goods, for you ought to know something about the things you eat or dont eat and if you dont eat Crescent Goods we are determined to fully explain to you their sterling qualities to convince you that they are upon the market solely on their me rit. The Baking Powder, for instance, has proved its merit, purity and wholesomesness by the remarkable increase in its consumption, for wherever introduced it is universally accepted. It is an Egg and Phosphate Powder, better able to do the work than the oldfashioned Cream of Tartar and at the same time it is more healthful, for science has discovered that Cream of Tartar when used for cooking is injurious to health while, on the other hand, a reward of $500 is offered for any injurious substances found in food made from Crescent Baking Powder. Many claim that Crescent Baking Powder is a cheap article because its selling price is 25 cents. This is far from the truth, for the actual cost of manufacturing it is identically the same as the cost of manufacturing the 50cent Trust article. Crescent Baking Powder is just reasonable—thats all, combined with highest quality. And where this combination can be found the article must appeal to every economical and thoughtful housewife. Again—the test of the oven—the housewifes court of appeal—proves that it produces sweet, wholesome food, free from a tendency to sourness, which is a constant menace to those of weak digestions. THE COFFEE DEPART MENT. There is scarcely any other staple used for dietetic bever ages that has made more rapid progress than coffee, and this should prove the fallacy of its injurious ef fects on the system. The injurious effects are not in the coffee, but in the quality. All healthy people will agree that good coffee is a most necessary invigorator, and the quantity consumed bears eloquent tes timony to the goodness of its reputation as a healthful in \ igoi aiing beverage. The Crescent Cream Coffee is a very carefully prepared highgrade coffee —a blend of Mocha and Java. it is always taken steam ing hot from the roasting cyl inders and sealed up in air tight 1 and 2lb. cans, and by this process retains its full strength and delicious flavor. When ordering Crescent Cream Coffee see that you get it in these sealed cans and that a coupon is enclosed. The next grade—the Cres cent 99 —is too well known to need much comment. It sells for 25 cents per pound and is always in paper car tons. Particular attention is paid to its drinking qualities. There once was a lady so dot tee, She Invented a nev kind of coffee; The neighbors all said, As they drank it with dread, Its hot water shes mixed with burnt barlee. Did you ever do this, some of you pioneer ranchers? » HRSmH A snapshot taken at the recent Labor Carnival in Seattle showing the Crescent Mascot (the donkey), the Crescent queen aid the Crescent Advertising Manager.

But now that Betty Bakes Best Biscuits Of Crescent Baking Powder, I wonder how I fell in love With Judith or with Polly. For Pollys tongue can sting and bite, And Judiths justice cloys, So Betty and her Crescent Cakes Will be my dearest joys. THE LABORATORY. Another important depart ment of the Crescent Manu facturing Co. is the Extract Laboratory. Flavoring ex tracts play an important part in the cuisine of the kitchen, and for this reason alone should be carefully bought by the housewife and thoroughly tested by her as to strength, flavor and economic qualities. The Crescent Extracts as sent to the consumer arc purer and stronger and there lore more economical than any manufactured in the world. They are on the mar ket purely on their merit, for they have received practical ly no advertising. Many of the old established brands are being sold upon their part reputation, and are not equal to the high standard of quality maintained by the Crescent. As an instance, the Cres cent Lemon, by test contains SO per cent, more oil of lem on than any other, and the Vanilla is made from the finest selection of Mexican Vanilla Beans, and these beans are noted for their del icacy of flavor, being the high est price of any grown, cost ing double that of the com mon Bourbon bean, so extens ively used by nearly all manu facturers.

June 5, 1917. Gentlemen: In the present emergency, the importance of husbanding the wheat supply is such that all wastes of wheat, no matter how small, must be stopped. With this necessity in view, the Com mercial Economy Board has conducted an inquiry into the wholesale bakery practice of taking back unsold bread from retailers. The investigation covered representative bakeries in all parts of the United States. It appears that approximately 4 per cent of all the bread delivered by wholesale bakers is later returned to them, and that at least onethird of this is sold for animal feed. A portion of the bread returned is sold at reduced prices to charitable institutions and the poor. The Board points out, however, that with the cost of carrying this bread to and from the retailers elim inated, the baker could afford fully as well as now to sell the same amount of bread at the same re duced prices. With few exceptions, the bakers consulted agreed that the waste of labor and human food involved in the practice of accepting returns is detrimental to the public interest and should be discon tinued. This also is the conclusion of the Board and of the Council of National Defense.

The phosphate mines at Hicks Crossing. He came here. Id sent Milly a message by him, the blackhearted hound! I heard no more of them, but when I reached the town I found them both. They had been married four months. They had a cabin in the fields, I, met her at the door. Her eye was blackened ancf her arm bruised. Hed done that the night before. I found him in the mines and put my knife through his heart. Whose heart?  screamed the smith, trembling violently. What was his name? Whose heart? Hinmans.

Anyway they are steaming hot and theyre the best ever when the butter and the sirup are stowed in be, tween three or four of them. Making hot cakes is comparatively easy if you know how and practice enough. Much of the science of hotcake makingis in mak ing them as they are wanted. They should never be made and then left for ten or fifteen minutes, or perhaps half an hourj while the family gets ready to come to the table. Hot cakes to be successful mean that the housewife must stay with the spapstone or the frying pan, or whatever she uses until everyone has had enough.

She was given profound atten tion by the committee, as she de manded that pending antitrust bills abolish cutthroat cut price com petition. Bargain counter scrambles was described by Mrs. Fredericks. She said that cut prices on standard arti cles were used by dealers as a lure, a bait and a snare to get women to stores that they might be stung on other extortionatelypriced articles. On one occasion, she said, I crowded around a bargain counter, hadmy plexls torsus twisted out of shape, suffered a dislocation of my dorsal humberis, wrecked my best hat, tore out the armhole of a good waist, and secured three yards of Valenciennes lace for which I paid only 78 cents. .

The methods and processes of each were secrets jealously guarded by industrial guilds and societies. In Queen Elizabeths time the practice of starching coifld only be learned by paying a fee of more than $100 a lesson. But modern industry is an open book. It invites confidence. And so, too, does our laundry. There is nothing about our plant or our methods but what would please you. In marveling at the snowy lustre of your linens, haven t you often wondered how such perfect cleanliness was obtained? Thirty rinses a minute in clear soft water and suds of pure white soap is the superior means by which we, in our modern laundry, achieve such results. We wash separately each class of goods that comes to us in your family bundle. The articles to be laun dered are carefully placed in a„ roomy washer, which in appearance resembles a bass drum about four times lengthened. Soft water and creamy suds are added. Send if The interior of the cylinder is very smooth, with none of 0 uwu the ripples of theancient washboard. IxT place of these are only a few finely polished ribs attached to the interior walls as a shelf might be fastened to a wall in your home. As the cylinder slowly revolves and reverses, the clothes are lifted and lowered easily in the soft water and suds, receiving thirty rinses a minute —just as the housewife washes a prized garment by lifting and lowering in a bowl. Instead of being rubbed out, the dirt is rinsed out by the suds and water as they surge back and forth through the weave. There is no pulling or straining. And to doubly insure purity and freshness, the water is changed from nine to twelve times while the washing of your clothes is in progress. Thirty rinses a minute—and cleanliness ! Isnt this a thousand times better than the old way of having your washing done? You send your family, bundle to us —and gain relief from the mess and labor of washday.

And today, Madam, this food still ranks highest in food value; RICHER THAN THE REDDEST MEATS, MUCH MORE NUTRITIOUS THAN POTATOES, BETTER BY FAR THAN BREAD! And its name is?RICE! But the reason, Mrs. Housewife, you have not thought much about Rice is because you have known but two or three ways ot cooking it, and no matter how you prepared it, Rice it remained in appearance and flavor. You have said, Why, to make it palatable it takes * much cream and sugar! And in that you were wrong! The Only Food That Is No Higher! Rice today, Madam, is the ONLY food that HAS NOT ADVANCED IN PRICE! And thousands upon thousands of families right here in this community, Madam, are eating rice in its most acceptable and delicious form. A ] ?  PDTAM r\C DIPCI miu uiai lurm ib?c>r\c/\m ur r\ic>ci Now let us take a pencil and figure it outl In the first place, CREAM OF RICE is granulated uncoated rice and powdered skim milk. It is ground to make it cook easily, thoroughly, quickly. It cooks in five minutes! CREAM OF RICE needs less.fuel to cook it than any other wholesome food. Told to the CREAM OF RICE Demonstrators in the Big Store (These are Remarks Made by Users of CREAM OF RICE While They Stop at the Demonstrators Tables.) W^e have learned to use it in so many ways that mother prepared an entire meal with it. First she served it as a cereal food, then the muffins, coffee cake and dessert?all from CREAM OF RICE. Never knew of any food to be used in so many ways. I thought it was only a breakfast food when 1 took home the first box. I didnt know you could bake with CREAM OF RICE. You ought to tell the people to try brown sugar on their CREAM OF RICE. I discovered how good it is with brown sugar one morning when we had no white sugar in tne nouse. now we Keen hrown mnr for our CREAM OF RICE. p roW SUR,r on h,nd It saves me making fancy desserts. We keep CREAM OF RICE cooked up in summer and winter. Never had such an easy food to prepare in the house. Sometimes we serve it hot and sometimes cold. _____ Baby loves it! _____ We used CREAM OF RICE for months only as a breakfast food before we knew of the many ways in which it can be used. We wouldnt be without CREAM OF RICE in the house than we would be without flour We bake so many different things wiTh i? and the whole family count on the coffee cake and muffins regulafly. Keep a supply of the cooked CREAM OF RICE Porridge on hand at all times and use it in many ways, to the increased HEALTH HAPPIVFCC and ECONOMY of your household and a sav*ofTIME andTROUBlI in the kitchen. ? 3F RICE?15c?makes 8 j ?   > ; ... ; SL USEWIVES LIVING! In the second place, CREAM OF RICE TAKES THE PLACE OF POTATOES AND ALL STARCHY FOODSI It may be served as a vegetable ? or in soups and gravies. It makes muffins, pancakes and puddings, and the most delicious breakfast food you ever ate. . y IT IS MORE NUTRITIOUS BY FAR THAN BEEF, PORK, MUTTON OR ANY OTHER FLESH OR FOWL. IT IS MORE NOURISHING THAN MANY GRAINS OR ANY VEGETABLE, and it will * reduce your food bill tremendously. Now, you pay 15 cents for a package that will make eight pounds of prepared food. That is about TWO CENTS A POUND! When you buy potatoes, N. cabbage, cauliflower, meats and other cereals, you buy some food and a great deal of waterl Half of Your FOODMoney Is Now Being Spent to Buy WATER! Well, when you buy CREAM OF RICE you get NO WATER?just FOOD. You add the water when you cook CREAM OF RICE?and the water costs you nothing! And you get BETTER FOOD?food that ?. .? .? / ? .1 builds bodies better?than any other tood on earth. Madam, if you and*other housewives bought and used more CREAM OF RICE, you would NEED LESS other foods?and when the demand for these other foods drops, then that great LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND is operating in your favor. When LESS of those food products is demanded, the price must retreat; cant help it. f And you need no mass meetings, no petitions to Congress, no riots! Today, with all your talk and fussing and fuming and worry, the solution of the food problem is right in your hands! You dont have to learn to like CREAM OF RICE.

If you spent just sixty cents a month for CREAM OF RICE your family would have 32 pounds of food more nutritious than the BEST MEATS or vegetables. And you could get along with LESS of the other foods. Indeed, CREAM OF RICE is the ONE food in the world that you and your family could live on with the addition of only a small portion of butter and eggs and still be healthy, rosycheeked, happyl VERY TRULY YOURS, CREAM OF RICE COMPANY, PHONE CALUMET 6435 Canal and Archer Ave. CHICAGO, ILL sounds of nourishing food!

It should be a matter of great rejoicing to the thousands of women who run the homes of V aihington especially in the Northeast Section. As everyone knows the elimination of the middleman makes for lower prices. The new arrangement of Northeast Market, with its covered booths of the many farmers and produce raisers markets does just this. Eliminates the Middleman Conditions permitting the sale of vegetables, dairy products, eggs poultn, etc., direct from the farmer who ib the producer to the housewife who is the consumer, makes for economy and loner prices. When the farmer can sell his products on the cit curbstone direct to the women of the Capital he has but one price. When these products pas through the hands of a middleman or retailer an additional profit over and above the farmers original price must be paid by the consumer. In many instances products which can now be bought direct from the farmer have heretofore had to pass through the hands of several such middlemen, each one adding his own profit, until it is small wonder that the housewife has been dismayed at the increasing high cost of living. Under the restored conditions which now maintain at the Northeast Market the products of the rich fields of Virginia and Maryland are brought right to the consumer without any middle man adding a cent to the cost. Eggs, fresh from the chicken houses, spinach, new potatoes, corn, tomatoes, home dressed meats, country butter, and the hundred and one toothsome and necessary foods of the farms are brought to the housewife at a single cost the price the farmer has earned for raising them. Another most important advantage that the housewife gains by patronizing the farmers and stalls of the Northeast Market is that of having her products absolutely fresh. Two Hours From Country to Kitchen Crisp, fresh vegetables with the morning dew still shining on them are displayed in pro fusion. In baskets and boxes, in wagons and stalls, on the curb and inside the market the greatest variety of choice fresh vegetables and fruits, with all of the zest that only absolute freshness can impart are arrayed at temptingly low prices for the women of the homes to pick and choose. This is recognized as both a morning and evening market. The wagons and baskets, crates and boxes laden with the choicest products of the fertile farms of Maryland and Virginia crowd the entire market place with their profusion. The pleasing aroma of fresh cut fruits and vegetables the smell of the real country hovers over the place and makes marketing a real pleasure aside from its more utilitarian idea of economy. The farmers bring their products straight from the fields and orchards direct to the market where the women can select them. The result is in many instances that but a few hours elapse betwen the time when the produce was picked and the time when it is ready for the table. Indeed the Northeast Market places the whole of the surrounding farm district right at the door, of the thrifty housekeeper. It is her garden patch where she can cull the choicest fruits and vegetables almost at first hand. Before she rises in the morn ing the farmer and raiser of country produce has been up, aroused by the crowing of the cock, and busied himself with cutting and plucking his produce in the wee sma  hours of the morning and has brought it in, eight or ten miles, to the city.

	"A10 News of the Mines and Oil Fields COPPER MARKET YET UNSETTLED GENTLEMENS AGREEMENT WILL NEVER BE REACHED EIGHT.CENT PRODUCERS STAND IN WAY Grant Sees in Situation Only Dlsapj pointment for Small Producer Should Issue Carry—No Merger Probable The socalled gentlemens agreement between copper producers now being discussed in New York with a view to regulating the market for the metal will never become effective according to Robert ]>. Grant, president of the American Mines and Exploration com pany, who has Just returned to Los Angelas after spending four months in the east. Mr. Grant and his asso ciate, Philip Wiseman, promoted the Ray Consolluated ami Gila Copper properties in Arizona, and recently dis posed of their interests for a sum in excess of $1,000,000 cash in a private sale to Bernard M. BaniCß of New York. Regarding the copper situation, said Mr. Grant yesterday, I do not look for a combination of Senator w. A Clark, PhelpsDodga and the Calu met and Hecla as going into any merger. , As for the socalled gentlemens agreement as discussed In New York, such a proposition would not carry for the reason that a producer of the metal around 8 cents laid down in New York would not feel like curtail ing in order to help out the other fel low whoso cost was around 11 cents a pound. 5 Decision Affect* Plans There were all kinds oftor1< go Ing about in New York concerning the merger and who would go Into It and upon what basis, but the recent decis lon against the Standard Oil changed a good many plans among: the copper people who were trying to get together. There Is at the present time quite a large copper surplus and all the mines seem to be working to nearly full ca pacity. The consumer Is buying only from one to two months ahead, M It would seem that there must come be fore long come kind of a combination by which production of the metal can be regulated. Every business bark east peetni bet ter and healthier, excepting the copper business, which I think Is due to the new porphyry properties sending Into the market a lot Ofcopper at low cost in addition to a very large output from the old mine.. We have nil been disappointed that the railroads have not gone ahead with the electrification of their lines as planned several years ngo. This advancement has been held up by panic, but as business improves electrical power will no doubt be util ized by most eastern railroads. When this change la finally made the pur plus of copper will be quickly wiped out. While enst Mr. Ornnt and family toured all through New York nnd the New England states In his automo bile. The country there. Is very beauti ful In the autumn, says Mr. Grant, but no place looked half .1 good as Los Angeles and we are all mighty glad to get back. One hears a great deal of favor able talk In the east about Southern California and especially this city, and this winter should witness a large In flux of visitors from that part of the nation.

	"Penny Pinching Not Always True Economy The housewife schooled in really scientific domestic economy no longer throws away a nickel to save a penny. A good way to illustrate this would be through a comparison of the wholesome ness, efficiency and economy of a plain flour and a standard baking powder and a socalled self rising flour. It doesnt pay to buy selfrising flour. Most of it is made, of low grade materials. It causes many bakeday failures and a great loss of expensive baking ingredients. x The housewife will throw out in wasted materials many times the amount she hopes to save. Beside, self rising flour has a tendency to get lumpy and thats another waste. But what is most important, the housewife gets less in return as far as food value is concerned than if she purchased a plain flour and a standard baking powder. ; True economy in baking powder de mands the highest quality at the lowest price. A Baking Powder made only of the highest class ingredients obtainable, so skillfully and accurately proportioned that it not only pro duces the maximum of leavening power but conserves that power, retains its strength and is unfailing in results, is economical in cost and use. The housewife saves when she buys it. She saves when she uses it and she saves the materials with which it is used. That is economy in its highest form the only kind of economy the housewife should attempt to practice. American Red Cross Dietitian.

	"FIRE INSURANCE REPORT. Wo have received from the National board of fire underwriters of New York tho report for December, 1009, of insurance conditions in Salt Lake City. This report is decidedly not flattering from ilia insurance standpoint; but it must bo remembered I hat. tho data and the criticisms are based upon any lapse from a perfect condition, and as Salt Lake City is not. perfect from tho fire insurance standpoint, the criticism is, as largely expected, routine. Thero is ample water,, to bo sure, and for Hho most part the hydrants are sufficiently largo and numerous, especially in the business part of town; and yet the tiro eouipment is not. fully up to dale nor in quantity as much as tho insuranco perfection requires. The forco is criti cised somewhat from tho political standpoint:; which is more academic than . actual; and thoro is declared to be an insutncioul number of men, which is no doubt true from tho standard of perfection standpoint of tho insurance companies. There is pretty severe censure of our fire box system, but that censure is based on a condition of neglect which existed in the early pari, of tho sum mer, and which has been corrected since, but; wo depend principal ly on tho telephono for firo alarms, so tho disuse of tho tiroalarm boxes is not so ma terial. But tho correction should have been noted instead of allowing tho roport of tho original bad condition to stand unrelieved. In tho general sum mar, tho water situation and its man agement, aro pronounced efficient and generally satisfactory. Tho firo ap paratus is pronouueed generally in good condition, but in minor equipment de ficient. Tho inspection is fairly satis factory, but tho building laws are of littlo value, most subjects of import ance being omitted. which is rathor a startling thing to say and unfair, as a matter of fact, to tho ordinanco as passed. Additional condemnation is made by saving structural conditions aro unsatisfactory on account of poor building laws. It is further stated that no provision is mado for prose cution of arson, which is nonsenso. Tho general statute is ample for such prosecution, and thero could bo no municipal ordinance that would reach the case. Any expectation based on the idea that prosecution for arson could bo conducted under city ordin ances is erroneous. The general effoct of tho report is rather confusing on tho whole, unless wo keep strictly in mind the idea ihat this report is made from the stand point of idoal insuranco conditions un der which fire is practically impos sible, and in which case, of course, there need bo no bother about insuring at all. The ideal condition from tho fire insuranco standpoint would neces sarily defeat its own cause, for if wo had it nobody need bother about insur ing anjthing. At the same time that there is much criticism of tho city from the lire in surance standpoint, thero is an admis sion of general results hero which is certainly very satisfactory, and miti gates almost entirely the force of tho criticism. The report sa3s (on tho soc ond page): The prross fire loss for the past five years, as Klven in tho reports of the chief of the lire department, amounted to S3S4.78G, the annual losses varying from ?1.11 In 1304, to $132,303 In 1007. and the number of fires from 187 In 1901, to 321 In 1008. Tho loss per fire has averaged 5321. and the yearly number of firoa 240. Based on an average population of 72,000. tho average number of fires per year for each 1,000 population was 3.32, and the average annual loss per capita $1.07, a low figure. With resulls like that, the insurance companies ought certainly to bo con tent, especially when wo consider the probability (the segregation of tho city premiums paid from thoso paid ;u the state at largo not being required by law) that they undoubtedly receive iroble (and perhaps more) tho amount of money in premiums over the total amount of firo losses. So that on tho whole, even from tho insuranco stand point, thn city of Salt Lake ought to be considered qn the average a mighty good fire risk. FULL CORROBORATION. During tho courso of the controversy between this paper and the Doserct News over tho assassination of Joseph and Ilyrum Smith, wo at ono time print ed part of a statement mado by Cath erine1 Smith, who was a sister of the two murdored men. Wc now havo that statement in fuller form, tho addi tional matter having been inacccsiblo lo us upon tho former occasion. As a means of more fully informing tho pub lic in this matter, wo reproduce this more complete statement, as follows: I was In Nauvoo a few days before my brothers were brought to Carthagu, where they met their death. I shall never for pet that Saturday, June 23, 1811, when I last saw my brothers alive. Joseph had preached a sermon lo tho largest crowd I have ever scon. It was his last sermon.1 1 might say. that It was more In the nature of a prophecy than a ser mon, for ho said, turning on the plat form where he stood and facing some of thr high prlosts and elders sitting there: There arc those among you who will betray mo soon; In fact, you have plot ted to deliver mo up to thn enemy lo be slain. Tho truth of this prophecy Is of history. Ho was betrayed, and by his own alleged best friends. Theso same fellows attempted to assume the reins of the church at his death. They not only attempted this, but thoy attempt ed to Introduce obnoxious teachings into tho church. My ncphow, the present Jo seph Smith, president of tho Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints at La monl, Iowa, Is the truo and only succes sor of Joseph Smith, tho martyr. It is unnecessary to mnko comment upon this matter; and it is morely pre sented lo further prove our contention that it was plotting and intrigue among tho Mormon priesthood , that brought about the death of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, just as wohavo all along contended, and proved by the best au thorities, and which contpntion tho Deseret News has persistently denied. As to who was entitled to lead tho church after tho death of the Smiths is none of? our concern, but is a matter to be decided between the contending factions themselves upon personal be lief. And yet it may be well, oven upon this matter, to refer to Whitneys His tory of Utah, because, possibly, the question of leadership may havo played a part in tho conspiracy to removo Joseph. In volume 1, on page U32, that work says: Of tho nbsent. Apostles. Parley P. Pratt was tho first to return to Nauvoo. Ueorgn A. Smith came next. Sidney P.lgdon ar rived a little later from Pittsburg. Brig ham Young, Hobcr C. Kimball, Orson Ilvde, Orjon Pratt. Wilford Woodruff arid Lyman Wight, who woro in tho Eastern States when tho tcrrlblo tidings reached them, returned to Nauvoo on the Uth of August, forty days after the massacre. Immediately aflcr this scramble for home ihero was a hot row on among all tho leading men of tho church, and be tween factions of tho saints themselves, as to who was to gel. the plum of lead ership. Plots and counterplots wore laid and executed. The community was  rent  with strife and un rest and .uncertainty pervaded the homes of tho people. But in the end Brigham executed a coup detat that completely shut out his ecclesias tical competitors. As tho head of the twelvo ho called a meeting in tho Nauvoo temple, stationed a lot of his supporters out in tho audience, and be gan, an impassioned speech. When the people were worked tip lo a high pitch of excitement his emissaries slolo quiet ly to ono and tho other, saying, Look! tho mantlo of Joseph has fallen upon Brigham! Dont you see? Thero is Joseph back again! Brigham is our leader! And Brigham won out. RAYNERS HOT ROAST. Sonator Rayncr has administored to Zela3a a roast about as hot as any which history records against a de generate ruler. TC ho were simpty a highwayman, says Senator Kayncr, wo might identify him; if ho were simply a tyrant, who oppressed the peo ple for tho purposo of robbing them, wo might particularizo him; if ho were a usurpor, who was only holding onto power so long as there was jlny money in tho treasury to stoal, orany further territory that ho could sack for private plunder, we could assign him a proper placo in tho ranks of somo of his prede cessors, and if ho were purely an as sassin, who regarded murder as a legiti mate profession through which he could despoil his victims of their possessions until the time came for him to flee from the hands of rctributivo ;justieo, it would bo easy also for anyone ac quainted with the political history of Nicaragua lo classify him. Ho is, however, all of theso things combined1. In the school of corruption, dishonor, perfidy and crime ho stands without a peer, and exhibits in ono glow of associated harmony the pride of every model and tho perfection of every master. And Mr. Rayner conliuucs that ho has been roliably informed. .that, .tho vices of his private lifo arc moro in famous in their indescribable dolails than tho iniquities of his public ca reer. Justly, therefore, he concludes that such a creature as this desorves the oxecration of mankind. Applying tho arraignment mado to the caso in hand Senator Raynor said: Now. as the culminating infamy of his administration, trampling upon every In stinct of humanity. In violation of univer sal law, In defiance of those precepts of the International code that havo been rec ognized ever since tho night of barbarism receded before the rays of civilization, ho has put to torture and then to death two American citizens who were not guilty of treason, who woro not spies, but whom ho had captured as prisoners of war In the army of the revolutionists. This act was not only tho act of a fiend, but was an Insult to tho honor of this republic, and cannot remain una venged. It Is absolutely preposterous for us to talk about Indemnity. Indemnity Is in recompense for murder. It Is said we ought to break off official communication with his accredited representatives. Wo have already done that and that amounts to nothing and Is a matter of absolute unconcern to him. Then It Is said wo ought (o declare war against Nicaragua. 1 think that Is unnecessary. This government Is a cowardly govern ment If It docs not make an example of Zelnya before the eyes of the civilized world. This case will not admit of any trilling or concessions. If two American citizens havo been murdered by Zelnya, then he must bo made lo pay tho pen alty of his crime. Once spread before tho American peo ple the details of the execution and our people will rise In arms and demand retri bution. They have not yet fully absorbed the significance of this deed. All of which is mighty vigorous talk, decidedly stirring to tho Amorican heart. And yet tho question must nat urall ariso, what; interest, the United Slates has in its allogcd citizens who enter the service of somo foreign power and meet their death either barbarously or othcrwjso while in that service. If wc extend the protection of our citi zenship to persons who havo abjured that citizenship by entering tho scrvico of other nations, or of thoao who would obtain powor in othor nations by insur rection or treason, than that is a prin ciple that is to bo onforcodnoL only as against Nicaragua, but as against any other nation or power. And if it is good international law, aro wo pre pared to enforce it, say against. Great Britain, Prance, German, or Russia? If wo aro, all right. If wo aro not, do not lot us mako bombastic bullies of ourselves by assorting it against weak and puny Nicaragua, when wo would not assert it agninst another nntion, ono of our own size. THE INTOLERANT SPIRIT. Wo vory often hear from the Deseret News concerning the spirit of tolerance that was exercised toward inhabitants of this valley when tho Mormon lead ers were in complotc control hero. Let us cito an cxamplo of it. Wc find it; in a sermon delivered by President Brigham Young at the timo tho south cast corner stono of tho Salt. Lake tem ple was laid and dedicated. It is in tho Journal of Discourses, volumo 2, pago 33, and roads as follows: We do not wnnL any whlnors about this temple. If you cannot commence cheerfully, and go through tho labor of the whole building choerfully, start for California, and tho quicker tho better. Heretofore wo havo quoted tho un polile invitations extended to Gentiles and apostates, by Prosident Young and llebor C. Kimball, that if thoy did not like I he oneman domination that ex isted hero, or objected to the manner in which things wore run, they could get out, and do it allfired quick. And hero, now, wo see (hat the same spirit of intolerance wns exhibited to ward even the Mormon poople, pro vided any of thorn disliked to bo im poverished for the purposo of construct ing an edifice in which thoy could be mado io swear vongeanco against, the United States, and submit themselves lo an agreement lo suffer the most cruel tortures and death in the evonl IhnL they divulged tho secrets thorcin confided to their keeping. Between ono thing and nnothor, it was a rathor jolly lifo that both Gen tiles und Mormons led horc in tho early days; and it goes without saying that if the power were possessed by tho presentday hierarchs the danco would be proceeding at a still livelier paco today. THE RULE OF THE ROAD. Tho Tribuno has been frequent in urging the rulo that persons mooting on the sidewalks should always turn to the right. This for tho purpose of convenience, uniformity, and to pre vent confusion and collisions. A cor respondent calls attention to this, and asks us to explain on that basis tho following despatch from Paris which appoarod in tho New York Timos: PARIS. Nov. 19 Pending tho time whon special njotor roads aro expeeied to form a network over Franee, a Par liamentary committee is busy drawing up a rulo of the road for tho country. Each Department hitherto has seemed to possess Its own rule, while In Paris no rulo is observed or enforced at all meeting vehlelos turning to tho right or left as Is most convenient for them. Tho plan of the committee Is to adopt the English system of keeping to tho left. This plan, which, as Americans will on sorve. Is the opposite of the rule fol lowed In tho United States, has tho ap proval of M. Millcrand, the Minister ot Public Works. Arguments In favor of the ICeop to tho Left rulo take the following shape: Tho English rule of proceeding to the left Is founded upon logic and good sense, and Is the result of tho experi ence of a pcoplo habituated to horses. The fact that a driver keeps to the left of Ih road and yet sits over the right wheel of his vehicle gives him a belter chance of steering, with a wider margin of safety, than the man who keeps to the right, and cannot. In conscouenco. gee how far oft he Is from Ills neighbors wheel. The advantago Is, also, to the English system In passing to the offside of a vehicle. Tho Keep to the Right style Is condemned because of tho dan ger to which It exposes the man who Is leading a horse. Tho driver of tho fast moving vehicle Is unable to see the man on foot until ho is right upon him. There havo been a large number of fatal acci dents for tills very reason on French roads. Meanwhile, It would bo Interesting to learn Just how tho Keep to the Right rule camo to bo established In the United States. Wns It Invented by tho colonists or did It becomo tho fashion as a sort of autlBrltlsh demonstration at tho time of the American Hovoltulon? Tho correspondent will note that tho Paris despatch noted refers to tho rule of tho road in driving horses or motor vohiclcs. It is, as staled, an awkward thing for thoso sitting on tho right and meeting a vehicle on tho rond to turn lo the right. Tho natural thing is for them to turn to the left, so that the driver can tho moro clearly seo tho spaco between his own vohiclo and tho ono he is meeting. This should havo been tho rulo in this country as well as in England. But tho rule of tho road for pedestrians is tho re verse of that for vehicles. Tho colon ists to this country from Groat Britain brought with them the rulo of tho pedes trian, which is to turn to the right. This from immemorial usage. Corre spondingly, they ought to havo brought with them the rule to turn to the left in driving, but thoy did not. On tho contrary, they seemed to consider that tho same rulo should apply to driving as to walking. It docs hot logically ap ply at all. Quito tho roverse. It would bo better if wo had hero a rulo to turn to tho left in driving all kinds of vehi cles, including automobiles. It is too lato now, however, to undertake to chaugo that tuIc. In France, as noted in tho despatch, thoro is great confusion, ono province followiug the one rulo and another tho other rule. In Paris thero is no rulo at. all. Tu seeking uniformity, there fore, the French authorities aro natural ly and logically following the rulo to tho left, in driving vehicles. Wo should bo glad if that custom had boon trans mitted to us from Great Britain. It is logical, convenient, and in every way reasonable. But wo dont havo it; and anjhow it has nothing to do with tho rule of pedestrians, which is in Eng land, as horc, to turn to tho right, and that is whufcwo aro endeavoring to iu culcato on our sidewalks. It is tho rule of gonoral application for those who walk, and it ought lo bo observed by ovorybody. Tho pedestrian in old times carried his shield on his left arm, and it was, a dofonse when ho walked in placo to tho right; but if ho wero bent on attack ho moved lo tho loft, so as to givo play to his right arm. Cor respondingly, the knightly horsoman was a man of war, always belligerent, and was bound to pass to tho left, in ordor to givo play to his lance. And tho men of war, whether afoot or on horsoback, laid down the law. It is observed that tho Dcsorot News prints a long editorial article on tho subject of denatured alcohol. Certain exports in criminology might sug gest to Cho church organ the pertinence of a pious dissertation upon the sub ject of denatured polygamies. A reported jewelry theft ih New York seems to bo regarded by tho police in the samo light as tho story of the man who blows his wnges and then ( tolls his wifo ho wns hold up. It is not so much that the small bpy dislikes school, ot course, as it is that ho has heard so much about so many great men having started out in lifo without education.

	"Another household problem solved City life did away with the family cow always concerned us. It has been a long time since households had to be selfsufftcient?since housewives had to weave their own cloth and churn their own butter. Progress has simplified the problems of house keeping. It has contribuied as much in comfort and convenience to the home as it has contributed in speed and efficiency to business. Many of the old problems were outgrown, or solved for all time. But throughout all the stages of our advancing life there has been one problem never entirely solved. The milk problem has From the days when Old Bossy, the family cow, was considered the only reliable source of the household milk supply we have sought the purest milk obtainable. Housewives especially have always been watchful of the purity of the milk supply, because on it depended largely the health of their families. But the circumstances of city life eliminated Old Bossy and with it, for most women, the drudgery of milking. Progress necessitated a new means of providing our milk sup? ply, and we came to depend on the milkman. It did not take long for the development of an intri cate system of milk transportation and distribution. No one questioned the excellence of the arrangement until the whole system became demoralized by irregular deliveries, labor troubles Krystalak eliminates the need and exorbitant costs. for daily milk deliveries It was not a case of finding a substitute tor milk. The trouble was not that the original cost of production of milk had risen so greatly, but that the huge bulk of fluid milk made it too expensive _o transport and handle in this day of high costs. Another difficulty was the great need of re frigeration and for quick distribution. j^i(|^j|y .1 ??1? I Then, as often happens in the field of science, this discovery was found to possess further benefits?advantages un dreamed of when the idea of Krystalak was conceived. Its many excellencies have been summed up very concisely by the U. S. Govern? ment in one of its booklets as follows: (1) Increased digestibility (2) Bacterial purity (3) Keeping qualities? no ice needed (4) Convenience?always ready (5) Palatability (6) Cheapness?no water (7) Transportation advantages?small bulk, does not freeze You can keep a supply on hand Anybody with judgment can understand the scientific and economic advantages of Krystalaks qualities, but only a housewife can appreciate how they simplify her problems in the household. What housekeeper has not had the experience of nnding that the milk has not been delivered in time for breakfast?or of discovering in the middle of baking that she has exhausted her supply ! And yet, who can afford to keep .a large sup? ply of fresh milk on hand just in case of emergency? Fluid milk costs too much and spoils too quickly. But with Krystalak there are no milk emergencies. You order it from your grocer along with other staples and you can always keep a few boxes ahead?a veritable reservoir of milk. You mix Krystalak, fresh from the box, in the exact quantity you need, by simply adding water. One great contribution is economy conquer space, * distance, tempera and time would have been im The fresh for science. changing pure, i V . K To ture possible except solution lay in milks form ? reducing its transporta tion costs ? removing that bacteria which necessitated refrigeration and daily delivery. The process was invented ? im proved and per fected. Today pure, fresh milk, ata factory situated right in the dairy dis? trict, has the fat removed from it, so that it will keep, and all the water dried out, so that its bulk is only onefifth that of fluid milk. The result is milk in the form of dry, sparkling, white crystals?KRYSTALAK. bulk to cut ____&____ Krystalak is made in the heart of the dairy district THE DOv un _? J**?^ i. ... NEWVORK But perhaps the greatest contribution science gave to the housewife in Krystalak is its economy. It furnishes you with milk at 10c a quart and saves still more by not requiring ice and never spoiling. After all, though, the test that, in the housewifes eyes, is more im? portant than any scientific test is the test of its results in cooking. Here it excels because of the very qualities we have emphasized before ?its purity, its uniformity, its freshness. a Cream soups, cream sauces, puddings, cakes, ;j muffins, chocolate and cocoa made with Krys? talak are both delicious and economical. But the surest and most satisfactory and, after all, the only way to learn the real worth of Krystalak, is to try it. Your grocer has it?packed in sani tary, water tight, blue striped pack ages. A package costs 50c and with it you can make 5 full quarts of milk ? 10c a quart. Its uniformity and purhy insure wonderful results KRYSTALAK ^Better fbrcoo&ing than fluid milk",

D., SEPT. 5, 1912 RESULT OF VOTE IN VERMONT THE VOTE IN VERMONT SHOWS CLOSE RACE BY THREE PARTIES White River Junction, Sept. 4.— The close race between.three parties republican, democratic and progres sive, in yesterdays election, was em phasized today in the revision of re turns of the vote for governor. The revised returns from all but thireyone small towns in the state are as follows: Allen N. Fletcher, republican, 28, 599. Harian B. Howe, democrat, 18,464. Rev. Fraser Metzger, progressive, 14,204. Clement F. Smith, prohibitionist, 1,429. Fred W. Shiter, socialist, 1,110. Failure of the republican candidate for governor to obtain a majority for the first time in the history of the state in an election preceding a presi dential election will necessitate the election of a states chief executive by the elgislature. It is expected the republicans will have a substantial majority in the legislature, although there are nearly eightyone towns yet to report on the vote for representa tives. The strength of the progressive vote was the feature of the election. Democrat? also increased their vote over two years ago. The falling off in the republican vote was wfAfj, Indications were that a great part of thedefeetion went to the progressives, although the democrats also gained And a few of the republicans went to the prohibitionist ticket. The result of the election was great party of .the state. Both progressive party af the state. Both progressive and democratic leaders professed to see in the result a good prospect to xthe defeat of the republicans in the presidential election in Vermont in November. COOMBS WITHDRAWS Valley City, N. D., Aug. 30.—Lee Coombs today issued an official an nouncement that he will withdraw from the race for Judge of the Fifth judicial district, leaving the Add to Judge Coffey, who will now have no opposition for reelection. This means that the election of Judge Cof fey will be mere formality at the polls in November. Mr. Coombs issued the following statement of withdrawal: To the people of the Fifth judicial district, state of North Dakota: After a careful resume of the re isult of the primary election held June 26, 1912, in so far as the same re lates to the judiciary, I have concludi ed that Judge James A. Coffey of Jamestown, is the choice of the ma jority of the voters of the district for the judgship, and, therefore, think it my duty to withdraw from the con test. I ascribe Judge Coffeys lead over me at the primaries to his incum brency and the claim of himself and 1 his friends for a second term. I do not consider the result as an expres sion of lack of confidence on the part of the people in me, or as a rebuke to my aspiration for the place. I thank the voters of Valley City and of the entire district for the sup port given me at the primary election, and I trust that should opportunity arise in the future we shall be able) to unite on some member of the pro fession of the law who resides here and elect him as judge of the dis trict, since I believe that to have the ^district chambers at Valley City would be far better for all interested, than to have them located at some other city in the district. Dated at Valley City, N. D., Aug. 28, 1912. Respectfully, —Lee Coomb* COLONEL TO SPEAK AT FORKS Col. Roosevelt will speak at Grand Forks next Friday as well as Fargo.

	"A CONTINUOUS JOLLY Doing business with the public is a continnuous jolly. THE JOLLY MANUFACTURER JOLLIES THE JOBBER. THE JOLLY JOBBER JOLLIES THE DRUMMER. THE JOLLY DRUMMER JOLLIES THE MERCHANT. THE JOLLY MERCHANT JOLLIES THE CLERK. THE JOLLY CLERK JOLLIES THE PUBLIC. And the jolly public jollies the whole jolly bunch by footing the jolly bills, and everybodys brimming over with jolly and you jolly well know it. Hence you see that business is a continuous jolly. With something at the back of it to make it successful, and that something is—MERIT. Yes! We are going to give you a little talk about the Crescent Goods, for you ought to know something about the things you eat or dont eat and if you dont eat Crescent Goods we are determined to fully explain to you their sterling qualities to convince you that they are upon the market solely on their me rit. The Baking Powder, for instance, has proved its merit, purity and wholesomesness by the remarkable increase in its consumption, for wherever introduced it is universally accepted. It is an Egg and Phosphate Powder, better able to do the work than the oldfashioned Cream of Tartar and at the same time it is more healthful, for science has discovered that Cream of Tartar when used for cooking is injurious to health while, on the other hand, a reward of $500 is offered for any injurious substances found in food made from Crescent Baking Powder. Many claim that Crescent Baking Powder is a cheap article because its selling price is 25 cents. This is far from the truth, for the actual cost of manufacturing it is identically the same as the cost of manufacturing the 50cent Trust article. Crescent Baking Powder is just reasonable—thats all, combined with highest quality. And where this combination can be found the article must appeal to every economical and thoughtful housewife. Again—the test of the oven—the housewifes court of appeal—proves that it produces sweet, wholesome food, free from a tendency to sourness, which is a constant menace to those of weak digestions. THE COFFEE DEPART MENT. There is scarcely any other staple used for dietetic bever ages that has made more rapid progress than coffee, and this should prove the fallacy of its injurious ef fects on the system. The injurious effects are not in the coffee, but in the quality. All healthy people will agree that good coffee is a most necessary invigorator, and the quantity consumed bears eloquent tes timony to the goodness of its reputation as a healthful in \ igoi aiing beverage. The Crescent Cream Coffee is a very carefully prepared highgrade coffee —a blend of Mocha and Java. it is always taken steam ing hot from the roasting cyl inders and sealed up in air tight 1 and 2lb. cans, and by this process retains its full strength and delicious flavor. When ordering Crescent Cream Coffee see that you get it in these sealed cans and that a coupon is enclosed. The next grade—the Cres cent 99 —is too well known to need much comment. It sells for 25 cents per pound and is always in paper car tons. Particular attention is paid to its drinking qualities. There once was a lady so dot tee, She Invented a nev kind of coffee; The neighbors all said, As they drank it with dread, Its hot water shes mixed with burnt barlee. Did you ever do this, some of you pioneer ranchers?

Judicious Judiths jams and jellies Touched me in my weakest spot, And when I ate them I confess Betty dear was near forgot. THE RANCH. But now that Betty Bakes Best Biscuits Of Crescent Baking Powder, I wonder how I fell in love With Judith or with Polly. For Pollys tongue can sting and bite, And Judiths justice cloys, So Betty and her Crescent Cakes Will be my dearest joys. THE LABORATORY. Another important depart ment of the Crescent Manu facturing Co. is the Extract Laboratory. Flavoring ex tracts play an important part in the cuisine of the kitchen, and for this reason alone should be carefully bought by the housewife and thoroughly tested by her as to strength, flavor and economic qualities. The Crescent Extracts as sent to the consumer arc purer and stronger and there lore more economical than any manufactured in the world. They are on the mar ket purely on their merit, for they have received practical ly no advertising. Many of the old established brands are being sold upon their part reputation, and are not equal to the high standard of quality maintained by the Crescent. As an instance, the Cres cent Lemon, by test contains SO per cent, more oil of lem on than any other, and the Vanilla is made from the finest selection of Mexican Vanilla Beans, and these beans are noted for their del icacy of flavor, being the high est price of any grown, cost ing double that of the com mon Bourbon bean, so extens ively used by nearly all manu facturers.

One has only to visit the oldtime attics of NewEngland farmhouses to receive ocular proof of the fact that the world do move along the line of labor saving Inventions and of articles of general utility. One here gets proof of the fact that customs change, and if proof w^rc? needed of the fact that Dame Fashion is a fickle creature such proof could here be found in abundance. If one would hark back to the past and find ones self in an atmosphere reminiscent of days of long ago, one should visit an old NewEngland attic in which the family heirkxima nave been preserved throughout many g?n?rations There are many such attics still uninvaded by the eager search?r for genuine four poster b?d steads and highboys that bear the sure mark of real antiquity. There are attics in which these searchers would go wiid, but not even this degree of eager enthusiasm ar?d of longing could indu.? the ...vriers of these ancient relies to part with a single one of them. Endeared and sacred by lifelong associations and by the touch of vanish?.! hands, some of these relics are not to be purchase i with any amount of money eager buyers may offer for them. What! Sell my own greattrrandmothers four pcister bedstead, that was a part ?if her wedding setting out and that she slept on sixty years and that Bbe died on? Why. my grand? mother and my mother were both born on that bedstead, and so was I. Sell if Well. I guess Ill be a good deal poorer than I I? at the pres? ent time before I sell it. That bedstead corns to me by will, and its going to my daughter by will along with greatgrandmothers silver spoons. There are in the old attics of NewEngland many articles of furniture that have been men? tioned in more than one will. It was not un? common in the old.n days to mention every article of furniture, every household utensil, down to a single teaxup or spoon, In ones will. It was the custom to give in such full detail a list of ones possessions that not even a shoe buckle or a candlestick was overlooked. That warming pan has been in our family nearly two hundred years, said an old woman, showing the writer some of her attic treasures. It was the custom, you know, to ?ll the pan with hot coals and pass It between the sheets of the bed on cold winter nights. And this little old foot stove came to me from my grandmother. She carried it to church hundreds of times, and sat with her feet on it during those long, long sermons in the unh^ted <hurch<*s they had in those days. And you know It was the custom for the minister to preach all the way from two to three hours, and nowadays p??ople begin to yawn and they make complaint if the preacher holds forth longer than thirty minutes, even in the beautiful and luxuriously comfortable churches we have In this day. Think of what it used to be when folks rode eight or ten miles to church in the biting cold and then had to alt in a church like a refrigerator without a sign of a stove In IL I guess these little foot stoves came in very handy in those days. One is sure to find in the old attic the spinning wheel without which no young woman felt that ehe could begin her married life in the days of long ago. Her evenings were spent before it and her spinning was her pick up work throughout the entire day. The old loom, clumsy and with tremendous possibilities as a producer of backache, b??ars silent testimony to the days when nearly every housewife wove the cloth for the garments of the entire family. She wove her own sheets and bedspreads, or kiver lids, as they were sometimes called. If she had a carpet at all it was made of the strips of rags 6he had cut and sewn together with patient care and then woven into a carpet with her own hands. Rag carpets are still woven in some rural homes, but the linen sheets and the blue and white or bluo frn?i red b??dspreads are woven no more. The ?aid churn, an object of loathing to the boys and girls who had to work Its dasher up and down, up and down, before the hutter would come, has had Its usefulness brought to a close by the modern creamery, and the custom of buttermaklng has become obsolete in nearly all farmhouses. The creamery man. an unheard of Individual a quarter of a century ago, now goes his rounds collecting the milk and cream from the farms, and the rural housewife does not make even the butter used by her own family. Hanging from some dust covered beam in the attic are the old candle moulds in which the housewife used to mould hr candles, if she did riot make them by the slower process of dip? ping them. What housewife of today dips taller or would dip it without protest? When she thinks of her candle (lipping days and of the flickering, feeble tight h. r candles produced, when compared to the lamps she has today, th? . ife Is inclined to regara the Standard OH ? ompany as something of a blessing, after aH. She is also thankful that customs change even In the matter of diet, and that the farmer who once lived almost wholly on pork, when It came ta meat, now uses almost no pork at all. Butcher? ing day has t>?eome a thing of the past on many farms, and lard has almost dis__pp*ared from Borne pantries in which it was never absent _B the days of long ago. The housewife does no*, fry everything In a sputtering lake of fat as ___(once did. although there are rural localities t_| whit h the frying pan still takes first rank as a cooking utensil, and everything that can bs fried goes Into it Lusty old scythes bear testimony to the fact that time was when the sound of the reaper and mower was not heard In the land, and the farm er swung his scythe from morning until night, cutting less with It In a day than he can now cut in an hour with the mower of modern inven? tion. The farmer of today owes much to th? inventive genius of the men of recent years, fo? his bam is supplied with labor saving imple? ments of which his ancestors on the farm be now owns knew nothing. He may work as hard as they did. hut he has the satisfaction of know? lng that his work counts for much more with tha implements he has at hand. We are not. like the people of many other lands, conservative in regard to adopting new customs and new inventions when we see that they are bttter than old customs and old inven? tions. We a_re not bound by custom nor by sentiment to the ways of our ancestors, although the writer knows of one old woman living in the heart of the city of Boston who today prepares all of her meals over the coals In the fireplace In which her mother and her grandmother cooked. She will have nothing to do with any **newfangled ways of cooking, and that ble___ lng of the housewife of today. the beautifully appointed kitchen range, has no charms for her. Modern invention has <__ven to the attic many household utensils once in common and weari? some use, and custom has wrought such changes that _f our ancestors who have been lying tn their graves these hundred years could come back to earth they would be almost helpless on a farm or In a kitchen of today, while a great, noisy, odoriferous, touring car of an automobile would no doubt cause some of them to feel that some of our modern methods of locomotion are open to criticism and some of our Inventions are not unmixed blessings.

The man was a lawyer, with mora conceit than ability; the girl was pretty, of the modest, simple minded, humble type, They will be very happy, said Mrs. Catt Their life after marriage will be an Ideal one,** Why do you think so? a spinster asked in a sour velee.

I have been connected with the movement for a Constitutional Conven tion over a quarter of a century. Ev ery time it has come up a coterie start the cry that this is an inopportune time. Each time they have a differ ent reason for the cry. Thig time the war is cited for an ex cuse, which is a poor one. Every right that free men enjoy has been won in battle and times of war. The armed barons in 1215 A. D. met King John on the field at Runnymede, and wrung from him Magna Charta, the very foundation stone of our rights as citi zens of a free republic. The right of petition for redress of wrongs, and the declaration of rights, were won at the point of the sword. The Declaration of Independence, our palladium of liberty, was written after war had been commenced and blood shed on battlefields, to wrest from England the right to a free gov ernment in America. Russia, the greatest country in area and population on the globe, only found her liberty in this great world wide war; and even now she is fash ioning and writing a new constitution that will usher her into being the lar gest republic in the history of the world.  The States of Massachusetts, Indiana and Arkansas will rewrite their con stitution in the year of our Lord 1917, while Illinois will vote on the subject of calling a convention. Even Holland, that wonderful little country ruled over by a woman, and begirt and threatened by autocratic Germany,, will this year also revise her constitution, thus displaying the spirit of the lion, which is the proud symbol of the manhood of the little kingdom. :Mr. Edgerton, who happens to be president of a part of the manufact urers of the state, made a proclama tion that he was against the constitu tional movement, because a war Is go ing on in European countries. The im pression was made that hfl spoke for the manufacturers of the state, but his own, members in Memphis have repudiated his position. , Seventeen editors, out of 180 in the State, in a meeting after an address by Mr. Edgerton, passed a resolution by 11 to 6 giving it as their opinion that we had best wait a while. What right have 11 men to speak for 180? A righteous war is a great arouser; it toughens the muscles, it hardens the fist3 and brings fresh air into the lungs; it exalts life to heroic heights; It kindles patriotism to a fervent heat. This is why the greatest charters and constitutions ever written were cra dled while shot and shell rent this world, and this old earth was being drenched with the blood of the eons of men. A few men here and there, with spirits like the mouse, say that Ten. nesseans are an exception to all man kind; that they can do nothing except mark time while charters and consti tutions are now Heing written by. the heroes of the age, for the liberty and advancing civilization of mankind throughout the world. . Tennesseans of old had the spirit of the lion, and we. indignantly deny that Tennesseans of today are the degen erate offspring of as noble an ancestry as Uiad. American, sail.

Music Notes WITH her assisting artistes, Francis Rogers, baritone, and Frank La Forge, pianist, receiving a wel come second only to that offered her, Madame Marcella Sembrlch added last night another to her long list of triumphs as one of the worlds greatest sopranos, singing to an audience which packed Simpson auditorium from door to roof. Chairs were 80 closely placed upon the platform that there was only a narrow pathway left for the artistes to at.d from the anteroom. Seldom has so large a house greeted any visiting artiste except Schumann Helnk. One wonders why Sembrlch has left the operatic stage and is now saying farewell to her thousands of admirers In a concert tour, for there is no evi dence of waning beauty or charm, her voice rises and falls full, clear and nweet, and she is still a queen crowned by an adoring multitude. Although she was programed for ten solo numbers beside two with Mr. Rogers, this sweet faced woman was graclousness itself in the matter of extras, and even after the close of the program, when she had come forward again and again to bow her acknowledments, when everyone was lingering, loth to depart, she took her place at the piano and played her own accompaniment to a final number. Mr. Rogers, who Is touring with Madame Sembrich, has a sympathetic baritone, exceptionally well handled and pleasing, and was received with marked favor, lie appeared to especial advantage In bis numbers with Sem biich. Mr. La Forge is well known to Los Angeles music lovers as a com poser, pianist and accompanist, and his line work of last evening served to re new the pleasant Impression made dur ing former visits.

Club News ONE of the delightful afternoon. Of the year was furnished members of the Southern California Wom ans Press club and friends yesterday afternoon by L. E. Behymer, who Hpoke informally of many interesting experiences With artistes, both mu sical and dramatic, whom he has miin aged during his long career as impre sario in the east and Los Angles. As. a rule the public knows only of the successes of the managerial cc and the speaker was followed with the closes! attention as he reviewed the difficult UPhIU Struggle to establish an art clientele on the Pacific coast, where, he says, we are all right cli matically, but geographically we are all wrong, a five days Journey from Chicago—ten to tho round trip—with few engagements between, failing to impress favorably many of the stars and virtuosos who find a Rood fll<i and ready money in tho middle west and Atlantic coast cities. There can be few phases of the nr tlHtlc temperament with which Mr. Behymer has not become familiar pro fessionally, and while many are of the variety which would drive any hut tho most evenly balanced impresario to a sanitarium, there are others furnished by sane artistes such as Modj ska nnd SchumannHelnk, which are among his most treasuried memories. Before Mr. Hehymer begun his busi ness career he had listened to the won derful eloquence of Hubert O. Ingersoll and Wendell Phillips. His earliest business venture was while he was yet in school, and was connected with a iyeeum course —prophesy of the time when he should be Southern California manager for Paderewskl. who recently demanded $57,000 for twentyono reci tals In and west of Denver. Mr. Behymer has been making mu sical history in and about Los Angeles Since the Old days when concerts were given In Hazards pavilion or in the little Unitarian church on Third and Mill streets and when Simpson audi torium was new. He was among the organisers of the Los Angelas Sym phony orchestra, was a factor in se curing dates with Patti in 18S6. and has volumes of reminlsci nee  of D* Pachmann, Ben Oreet, Bernhardt, Maxine Elliott, Calve, Frank Mayo, James Hearn. John Drew, Mauda Adams, General Lew Wallace and others. It is Interesting to learn that as a lecture Ren Ilur was born before its time in Los Angeles. General Wallace, who harl Issued Ills famous book by the same title and had the lecture ready in tentative form, ha,i been annou to speak In Los Angeles on a different topic. The lecture announced had to do with the recent unpleasantness between the north and the south, and for reasons bearing upon the box offlc? receipts Mr. Behymer Importuned tjii Wallace to change his topic. which was done for  consideration of pal hundred dollars, nnd Ben Hur, Immature but clothed In all the magic robes of (he authors eloquence, was delivered to a crowded house. In a marked degree has Mr. HehyYner enjoyed the personal friendship of tome of the greatest artistes of the day, an Instance being the confidence ,1 in him by Mme. Modjeska. who left to ills custody her large and valu able collection of manuscripts and books, and intrusted to him the proper i.lstrlhution Of the same according to wishes expressed by her. HlHzeal in the cause of art has alno received recognition In Europe, and amr.ng his valued poMAMloni \< I <] e oration received list year from the French academy.

PINCHOT URGES RAILROADS TO TAKE UP REFORESTRATION President Mudge, in Reply, Says Gov. ernment Ownership Is a Possibility CHICAGO, Doc. 14.—Th. purchase of timber lands and their reforestation by the railroads of the Vnited States was urged by Gifford Plnchot, chief forester, at a conf< rence here today of presidents and officials of the lead Ing railroads. Mr. Plncbot suggested this scheme as a means of preserving the forests and at the Same time to provide rail road ties and posts for future use. Replying to the suggestions by Mr. Pinchot, President Mudge of the Chi cago, Rock Island & Paciflo declared that in view of the possibility that within fifty years the railroads might be under government ownership the national government should provide for the future needs of the railroads.

My advice to housewives is: Dont boycott bak ers bread yet! So declared Mrs. Julian Health, president of the National House wives league, with a membership of 7,000,000 housewives in all parts of the country, when she announced her policy toward the action of the master bakers associaion in an at tempt to do away with the 5cent loaf of bread entirely and substitute the 10cent loaf. The Housewives league will not consider a boycott before an investi gation I have just ordered is com pleted, said Mrs. Heath. If bakers were boycotted the sub stitute for their services would be simple. The housewife could bake her own bread. But it is possible the action of the bakers is along the line of progress and economy. I believe in a standard 10cent price for bread rather than a 5cent price. There is greater economy in it for all con cerned. . The small 5cent loaf costs as much to wrap, handle and deliver as the 10cent loaf and with the price of labor, flour, oil and other materi als rising, the bakers may fairly plead thaTpBrhapsa penny should be added to the cost of the small loaf while the purchaser of the larger quantity should receive it at trifle smaller price in proportion to fthe amount received. This is an inevitable economic condition. The consumer findsthat all commodities are cheaper if pur chased in large quantities. But while in the case of ice, milk and butter, housewives of very small means can not possibly buy and keep the larger quantities, nearly every housewife can afford to buy the 10cent loaf. By a 10cent loaf I do not mean a loaf of standard size. We have al ways advocated a standard price and have always recognized that the baker should be allowed to vary the size of the loaf he sells at that price. This is fair because the bakers raw materials constantly fluctuate in price. But a sure way to prevent exploi tation under this system would be to compel the baker to label each loaf sold at the standard 10cent price with its exact weight From the housewives point of view, why should we not have the 10 cent loaf? Bakers bread is more healthful the second day than the first and every family will consume practically all of a 10cent loaf with in two days. Even if a little remains it is never wasted. Dry bread is best for toast It can be used also fo French toast a breakfast in itself. Stale bread can .always be kept and used up in breadedmeat and fish, in dressings with roasts and steaks, on top of shirred eggs and for all sorts of des serts, from simple bread pudding to Brown Betty. There should never be the slight est waste in hread. There is only one danger and that is that bakers might juggle the thing and use the tencent standard as a means to con ceal an unfair profit But the Housewives league is in vestigating this. If price juggling and reduction of the nutritive Value of bread Is proved, a boycott orrbak ers bread might well have the same quick effect our famous boycott of eggs did in bringing the price back to rock bottom! mmmmmmmmmmim",
	"are millions of families that rely on bread as a considerable element in their daily sustenance. It is a hard ship for them to be educated up to the tencent loaf. As far back as February, 1915, we heard rumors of the 6cent loaf. And after a well managed propaganda of about 16 months the bakers now think they have eduucated consumers up to the 10cent loaf! The small baker who runs a lunch counter to make the profit which he cant make on his bread, and the large  wholesale manufacturer of bread have taken the place of the good old New England housewife, and the public pays the price. r fWh.y not have every home a mo del bakery? The conveniences for the kitchen have kept pace with the new facilities for the big bakers. I am talking now of the housewife who tries to be chiefly a home mak er, and whose husband earns a small fixed wage. Suppose hers is a family of six and she has to buy seven 10cent loaves a wee.k. That is a conserva tive estimate. She spends 2.80 a month for bread. Think what she could save if she baked her own bread! And she. would know, more over, what were the ingredients mak ing up her loaf, and would be sure of its cleanliness. Of course here each family would have to go up against the increasing cost of flour, and to iheet this, and decide the future of our foo.d supply, there must be concerted action on  the part of all American women !

	"THE BALANCED RATION ANOTHER LESSON IN COLLEGE HOUSEKEEPING COURSE , Economical housewives are really . such as to demand meat more than very extravagant when they serve too much of one kind of food mate rial at a meal and not enough of oth ers. A balanced ration is one which contains the right proportions of the elements which the body requires. The third lesson in The Day Book home economics series is one which will interest every housewife. It is by Prof. Mary E. Sweeny, dean of the State University of Kentucky. Prof. Sweeny is famous for having accomplished an invaluable amount of work for the women of Kentucky through womens clubs. BY PROF. MARY E. SWEENEY (Dean of State Univ. of Kentucky.) The body is like a steam engine in that it needs fuel put into it. In the engine the fuel is coal and wood, in Jthe body it is food. When coal burns in an engine it gives heat and power; so also when the body uses food it gives heat and power, v The foods which the body uses for fuel are; starches, sugar and fats; they not only keep the body warm but they give power to move around, to go up and down steps, to sew on the sewing machine, to churn and to do the many tasks of the housewife The engine wears out as it is used. The human machinery wears out also. Every day many cells of the body wear out and cease to do their work. fJew cells must be made to take their places. The principal food ut of which these cells are maae is cotnained in meats, egg, fish, cheese, milk. How much repairing does the body do every day? It depends on the amount of work the body does. If a person is busy out of doors, sweeping or using many muscles, more repairing will be nec essary than if one sat in a chair and embroidered fdr half a day. How I ever, the repairs are scarcely ever once a day. Eggs, milk and cheese can replace meat and are better for the body. Peas and beans also take the place of meat. Oatmeal, wheat and nuts contain repair material. Growing boys and girls, six years old or more, need more meat and eggs in propor tion tp their size than a grown per son because their bodies are not only repairing the cells daily wearing out, but also are making new cells in bones which axe growing longer, muscles which are growing larger, and in fact all the body tissues. If the weather is warm and the body, is just about the same tempera ture as the air, no large amount of heat is being lost, so smaller amounts of food will be required than when the weather is cold and the body must give up some of the heat to the told outside. From this it is evident that the season influ ences the amount of starch, sugar and fats to be eaten. The use of rich puddings, pies, fruit cakes, heavy meats should be confined to winter, and vegetables, fowls, frozen desserts, milk and eggs used in summer. Fats give Jthebody more heat than starches, .so fried foods, if served, should be used in winter. (Another home economics lesson by Prof. Mary E. Sweeney tomor row.) o o .

TAKE CRIMP OUT OF SUGAR FAMINE BY CAROLINE COE Here are the rules for sugarless preserves. Follow them carefully and you wont need to worry about the sugar famine. Boil the fruit in water without sugar. Scald the jars, put the fruit in while they are still piping hot Use fresh, firm fruit. Overrope fruit is likely to spoil. Keep the jars airtight. Add sugar when the preserves are served at the table. European war has spoiled the Eu ropean sugar crop and trebled the price of sugar in America, but it hasnt spoiled the plans of the Amer ican housewife for her fall pickling and preserving. The American housewife had the will, and now shes found the way, to offset the effect of sugar famine. Shes going to do her preserving by a sugarless method. And it can be done. As every ex perienced housekeeper knows, its HEAT that counts when fruits or vegetables are to be preserved. Heats the thing, not sugar. Canned fruit is nothing more or less than sterilized fruit; if fruit Is perfectly sterilized it may be preserv ed or canned without sugar, and the sugarless preserves retain every bit of the flavor of the natural fruit. The sugarless way of putting up jfruit is like any other way, except that you leave out the sugar. But special attention must be given to scalding the jars and they must be red hot when the fruit is poured into them. Plums, apples, peaches, pears, pine apple in fact, any of the fruits usually put away for winter may be preserved without sugar. The house keeper may use her own recipes. The only difference is she put in no sugar. o o Before washing fine lace or mus lin collars and cuffs baste them on to a piece of heavier muslin, finding it excellent to prevent their tearing or stretching in the process of launder ing. o o i klVl ItTTPP itXI ICO uo PRONOUNCED ALL THE NAMES IH THESE WAR SFWTCHES, HE CAN APPRECIATE WHATSHEBMAH SAID CFW&..

Read her instructions care fully, practice the steps, study the photographs and join the rest of the world in dancing thetatao. Im BY MISS EDNA NEIL Formerly with Pavlowa in the perial Russian Ballet. First Position Lady and gentle man facing each other, hands as In illustration. Gentleman steps for ward with the left foot, touching only the heel. Lady back with right foot, touching the heel. This is continued from side to side, the lady always going a little backwards, first with the right and then with the left. Second Step Pas de bourrie. Gen tleman back with right foot, step left, cross the right and point with left, going to the left in thisflgure. Now continue this same figure to the right, the gentleman putting the left foot back, step with right and point with left. As the lady is facing the gentleman she puts the left foot back when the gentleman puts the right foot back, always using the op posite foot to the gentleman. Third Step Gentleman back with right foot, hold the balance on right foot and make a tiny kick with left. Gentleman then steps with the left forward, turn, put the right foot back, left foot back and, holding the weight on left, kick the right. This is repeated, first turning to the left and then to the right. That is, first looking over the gentlemans light arm and then his left arm as he stands in dance position, both lady and gentleman facing each other. Fourth Step A pas de bourrie as in the second step to the gentlemans left, after the point with the heel, a Chinese salaam. That is, both bend forward, gentlemans left foot ex tended straight to the back, ladys right foot extending to the back. Then both bring the extended foot forward, leaning away from each oth er, the gentlemans left foot and the ladys right foot together in front. For the fifth, sixth and seventh steps the second, third and fourth steps are repeated, with the gentle man back of the lady, both facing the same way and both using the right foot at the same time instead of fac ing each other. The finish of the dance is very unique. The lady bends with her feet crossed, making a bow. The gen tleman stands above her as in the photograph. o o THE KITCHEN SINK The kitchen sink has commanded the attention of the scientific brains of the agricultural department, jaxid for the liberation of the housewife a bulletin is now published which de clares most sinks are too low for even a woman of medium height to wash dishes without stooping and it would be better to have a box or stool for a child or short person to stand on than to oblige a tall woman to stoop to a low sink. The bottom of the sink should be not less than 30 inches from the floor and 31 inches is better for a woman of average height. In the same bulletin are a lot more hints about rearranging stove, table and sink in their relation to the pantry door and the dining room door, in order to save steps for the housewife. o o LORDS AND Of course its regular and all right, but it does sound funny to hear King George open parliament with, My lords and gentlemen: Should President Wilson, in ad dressing congress say Senators and gentlemen there would be folks who would take it that gen tlemen applied to members of the house only.

Housewives at the meeting made no objection to this valuation Among the other statements made by Mrs. Morgan were: The mother who earns a living for her family Is only worth half as much if she devoted her services as a mo ther. Training in spending money is as important as earning it. Instruction in domestic science should begin in sixth grade in public schools, and that the average girl makes a poorerjiqusewife than the girl who has never been thrown upon her own resources.

DYSPEP&JA is the skeleton al. the feast; the deaths bead aX the festive board. It turns cheer into cheerless ncsx. paicty into doom and festivity into farce. It is tbc pltost in Iho home, hauntinp over room and hitting at; every fireplace, malciup otherwise mer ry people shudder nnd fear. If there is one. disease more lhan another that, should be promptly attacked and worsted, it. is DYSPEPSIA. . It is the very pen ins of unhappiness. unre.st. and ill nature, ln time it will turn thn best man almost into i demon ol tem per and make a pood woman tomcthiiip to be dreaded and avoided. It is estimated that .hall: ol ones troubles in this world conies of p stom ach pone wrong of Dyspepsia, in short. Foods taken into tho stomach and not properly cared for: converted into substances Ihat. the system has no use for and hasnM. ?ii3 notion what to do with.

If you were, bitten by a mad dop. you would not lose a day in going to a cure; do you know you should be just as prompt with Dyspepsia?

Onn writer says of it: Stuarts Dyspepsia Tablets arc lit tle storehouses of digestion whiehmix with. Ihe stomach juices, digest, food, retinnle the mucous membrane nnd its nerve centers, give to the blood a great wealth of digestive fluids, promote di gestion nnd stays by the stomach until all its duties are complete.

Dyspepsia Tablet: they aro easy nnd pleasant to lake and no nausea or ill feeling follows. There is none of this getting allovcrthemouth  like a liquid and mnking the remedy a drend. Another writer says: Tt matters not what the condition of the stomach, Stuarts Dyspepsia Tab lots only improve the juices and bring quiet to the wholo digestive cnaal, of which the stomach is the center.

In can and should sub stitute dnncing as an exercise, and amusement for the young people of both sezes. It furnishes indoor, lively and graceful exercise, and leaves no ex cuse for dancing; I wish there were a roller skating rink in every village. Salzman, in his valuable work on Toxcrcisc, says: It is an exercise superior to anything that; cau he classed under tho head of motion. Tt excites such pleasure in the mind of tho per former that T should recommend it as a most efficacious remedy for many ills. Campc. writing on the same subject, says: It is necessary that; we relax our minds at various intervals and lake recreation of some kind. T know of no more pleasant or beneficial exercise than the modern roller skating, and ev ery boy or girl, man or woman ought to learn it. Royal Stale Bread Depot. Open 3 to 5 p. in. daily.

Maybe the hard necessities of war will shoot a lot of sense into folks in the matter of eating. The reader will kindly permit us to figure some good out of war, if we can, wont he, or she? Certain it is that in no other mat ter has man made so big a fool of himself, and it appears likely that the race would be better off if it had no sense called taste. At any rate, it is the sense which man has permitted to corrupt himself, physically, men tally and morally. Many of our social evils, most of our economic weaknesses and about all of our physical ills can be traced back to perverted taste. Charge up against ambition to live high fully half of the social and domestic fol lies and disasters; charge, up against the cravings of abnormal and Vcul tivated appetites a big part of our economic weakness and silliness; charge up against senseless feeding 90 per cent of the cost of drugs, doc tors and hospitals and you have the bill to render against the fact that we eat with the sense of taste alone and without exercising our brain fa culty. Man is about the only animal who, packs his stomach when he doesnt need food and who makes a specialty , of picking out foods that he is least able to assimilate. But when war cuts down all sup plies, nations begin to exercise their brains. The folks are then informed that food is eaten to be converted into heat or power, and that certain foods produce, under digestion, cer tain units of heat, or power, which units are called calories. Now, if it were not for this sense called taste, which we have cultivat ed to curse us, socially, morally and physicaHy, we would, every one of us, at all times, be eating the foods containing the most calories; that is, we would eat intelligently. More over, we would eat economically, for it is fact that the cheaper foods are the higher in calories. One day, way back, Mrs. Smith said: William, I declae I must run over to Mrs. Jones and find out how she makes her lovely, light, white bread. JLis so, much nicer looking than our whole wheat bread! And to this day the housewife with love ly, ljght white, 10calory loaves get credit over the housewife with 60 calory bread. Looks! Taste! Arti ficiality! Heaven only knows when man be gan tearing at the flejBh of his warm blooded fellowcreatures. His den tition would indicate that he never Was intended for it. But he gets riotous over the high cost of a pound of 800calory veal, when he can get fish or cereals at half the cost, with twice the powerproducing quality. But you dont like to be talked at in calories, and you donf like rice rather than potatoes, fish rather than beef, cornmeal rather than that nice white, light flour. Taste! Habit! Thats all. The good sense, the econ omy, the physical progress lie in combatting the perverted taste. War actually may make folks eat things that are best for them, and, when you get down to the nubbin of the matter, this is really hardship only when the corrupted taste in stronger than the mentality. . .ijfuj cujiLu Q.ji.ujjC,.;i!Jj",

Now, if it were not for this sense called taste, which we have cultivat ed to curse us, socially, morally and physically, we would,, every one of us, at all times, be eating the foods containing the most calories; that is, we would eat intelligently. More over, we would eat economically, for it is fact that the cheaper foods are the higher in calories. One day, way back, Mrs. Smith said: William, I declae I must run over to Mrs. Jones and find out how she makes her lovely, light, white bread. It is so much nicer looking than our whole wheat bread! And to this day the housewife with love ly, light white, 10calory loaves get credit over the housewife with 60 calory bread. Looks! Taste! Arti ficiality! Heaven only knows when man be gan tearing at the flesh of his warm blooded fellowcreatures. His den tition would indicate that he nevei was intended for it But he gets riotous over the high cost of a pound of 800calory veal, when he can get fish or cereals at half the cost, with twice the powerproducing quality. But vou don t like to be talked at in calories, and you dont like rice rather than potatoes, fish rather than beef, cornmeal rather than that nice white, light flour. Taste! Habit! Thats all. The good sense, the econ omy, the physical progress lie In combatting the perverted taste. War actually may make folks eat things that are best for them, and, when you get down to the nubbin of the matter, this is really hardship only when the corrupted taste in strong? than the mentality. fcfe. . nu ... .

DONT SELL THEM Companies are offering to buy your Liberty Bonds from you, or to pay yon a percentage of the amount paid if yours was a timepayment bond. Large retail concerns, and other cor porations advertise that they will take those bonds of which ou were once so proud, and exchange them for other articles. Despite the fact that the bands are below par, many persons are secri ficing the difference between the cost price and the market quotations, and allowing these companies to buy in large amounts.

	"THE WINNER The Majestic R^nge always comes out a winner, because its like the thoroughbred racehorse. Its got the blood. Everything that goes to build a Majesticßange is of the very best that brains, money and skill can produce. There are a lot of ranges on the market today, some good, some poor, but among them all the Great Majestic stands out alone. It bears the same relation to other ranges on the market as the thoroughbred does to the draft horse in a fin ish race. We back the Majestic because we know whereof we speak when we say that the Majestic Range is absolutely the best in the world. Every housewife who has used one will corroborate our statement. A Majestic Malleable Iron and Steel Range will last a lifetime, properly handled, and youll say after using one that the price paid was the best in vestment you ever made. The first cost of a Majestic Malleable Iron and Steel Range is just a little more than cast iron or a cast iron and steel range, but there are good reasons for it. When yon buy a Cast Iron Range or cast iron and steel range, voir re getting, at best, a temporary affair, ami a range that will be a source of constant trouble and expense. A Majestic Malleable Iron and Steel Range is a permanent fixture, and a saving bank in fuel, food and repair bills. IT IS BETTER TO INVEST $100 THAN THROW $50 AWAY. 7",

A t)OULRiS CcX,VKy WORTH OF EGGS 48 Dozen j 3 dozen BY FREDERICK M. KERBY Washington, June 13. The house wifes dollar has shrunk to 50. cents. So says the U. S. bureau of labor statistics in an analysis of the pur chasing power of a dollar covering the years from 1890 to date. In 1890, for instance, the thrifty housewife could get 8 110 pounds of round steak for about 12 cents. By the end of 1915, however, her dol lar would buy less than 4 V pounds of round steak, which had gone up to more than 22 cents a pound. It is the same with sirloin, rib roast, pork chops, smoked bacon, ham, lard, chickens, eggs, butter, milk, flour, cornmeal and Irish pota toes. Some have not advanced so sharply in price, but all show a de cided increase. Back in 1890 a dollar would buy 9.3 pounds of pork chops; by the end of 1915 the same dollar would buy only 5.4 pounds. In 1890 eight pounds of smoked bacon could be had for a dollar; by 1915 the dollar would se cure only 3.6 pounds. This period of 26 years dies away with unusual fluctuations in making comparisons and enables the bureau to estimate the steady rise in food prices which has taken place. One of the most remarkable of these is the increases in the price of eggs. In 1S90 the average retail price per dozen of eggs was little more than 20 cents. Thus 4.8 dozen eggs could be bought for a dollar. la",

BY BIDDY BYE Every time the housewife pays the meat bill she is convinced she must use more of the cheaper cuts. But what to ask for andliow to cook the meat so her family will not protest is often a big problem. For all practical purposes, says one of Uncle Sams cooking experts, it may be considered that the pro tein obtained from meat differs little either with the kind of meat or the cut. The maximum is in the porter house; the minimum is in the brisket of beef. But the PRICE of different cuts is significant. Women who buy the cheaper cuts need not feel that their families will be less well nourished. The method of cutting the sides of beef, veal, pork and mutton vary in different localities, and the names of the cuts likewise vary in different parts of the countryr Prices will warn which are. the prime cuts of a beef carcass. They are all the steaks and roasts adja cent to the backbone between the rump (16) and the chuck (2).

	"Tun Indian Advocate. 79 Naoman sat down on the floor with his back against the logs which formed the wall, The children played with the beads which hung in a long string around, his neck. Are you hungry? askecl the good housewife. Many times she had fed the chief when game was scarce1 and his own people starving. In a thousand ways she had been kind to him, and he had shown appreciation in many WaysV Naoman not hungry, he muttered, finally. Naoman will tell you something. First you promise that you will tell no one, not even your husband. It is a secret of the tribe, and no Waorneck has ever betrayed his people before. The woman, all attention, came near, to him and prom ised to keep the secret as she would her life. Tomorrow at sunset the Indians will come to killyou all, was the startling information which fell from, his lips. They will burn down the house, kill the children before your eyes, torture your husband and carry you away with them. Naoman has spoken, andnothing but the truth. .Go, dowmthe river. t Then he arose, pushed the children aside gentlyand strode across the clearing. The woods hid him in a moment, and the woman was alone with her children and her fears. Without telling her husband, she persuaded him to start dowh the river the next afternoon. She told him that ; she was frightened. They were actuallyin their cande when the Indians swooped down upon them. Naoman was in tire crowcl which surrounded the poor wretches, but he knew them ndt. The Indians demanded to know why they were leaving tWeir clearing in such a hurry. They insisted roughly on knowing the name of the one who had betrayed their plans. The hus band did not know, and the wife would not tell. They bound her to a tree and tortured her for a time, and when she recov ered from a fainting spell they offered to set her free and to spare the children if she would tell them.",
	"ii4 The Indian Advocate. Those who possess any real excellence think and say the least about it. Slugs crawl over our cabbages as the worlds slander crawls over a good name. You may kill them, it  ; true, but slime remains.  To procure real domestic happiness, four things are neces sary: A merciful God, good health, a good housewife and a happy death. Inspire a child with right feelings, and you will govern its actions; hence the truth of the old adage: Example is bet ter thanzwr. The best, the surestcourse is never to have recourse to deception, but prove ourselves in every circumstance of life equally sincere and upright. Although war is still waging in the Philippines, neverthe less the Benedictine monks of .MountSerat (Spain) have for several months past taken up their peaceful employment of educating the natives. Despite the fact that some of them have been in danger of death (being accused of treason to their country), the good Fathers, with a truly Christian ven geance, have decided to devote their energies to the wellbeing of these benighted people. To this end they have erected at Tanday, one of Manilas suburbs, a college, which at present numbers 60 boarders and 140 dayscholars. The Philippino of today is in great need of a solid education. A new sedu cer has again appeared in the person of American sects and our Government, both of which are bent upon the introduc tion of their pernicious school system.",

The fertility of the soil of the country tributary has been given much publicity; every body knows that it is here, now it is up to the community to be up and doing. To obtain the best.results to both individual and community, it means that the farming must be carried on by intensive methods,, as well as make every possible bit of available land productive. First Electrical Pumping Plant Installed in This Section One of the Potent Essentials in Bringing This About Is The Power of Electricity Other sections are doing it, why not M issoula, and the surrounding country? By means of the electric pumping for irrigation, California has reclaimed over 350,000 acres of hereto fore worthless land, Idaho, 300,000 acres, Washington and other states hundreds of thousands of acres more. Therefore, it is no Ion er a question of experiment. Aside from the irrigation problem, the application of electricity to many other farm purposes makes it possible for the farmer to realize and actually enjoy all the conveniences of the city as well as introduce the economy of costs element. Labor saving devices can be installed everywhere. The housewifes work can be as easy as that of her city neighbors, but unde r much better conditions.

	"strings of small copper or silver coins. Most of the houses in the vil lages are of a single story. The kitchen is generally also the liv ing room, and pigs, fowls and ducks, goats, and other domestic animals run in and out as much at home as the owners. The father and mother sometimes pos sess a bedstead. The children, even when grown up, have to be content with mats spread upon the floor, of hardened mud. The Bulgarian housewife is a good one. Tidiness is held in high es teem. Women of the higher classes in ihe largeV towns are often ac complished, and have an intelli gence concerning national affairs. The Servian.race is afine, stal wart one, and the women are gifted with many of the physical characteristics of their mankind. They are also extremely hospi table, energetic and thrifty. But save in the larger towns and vil lages the houses are mostly mud hovels. The Servian farmer, however, is not so poor as he looks or pre tends to be. He could in most cases undoubtedly afford a more commodious and comfortable house. But centuries of oppres sion from the Turk, constant ex actions and frequent illtreatment, have made him cautious of exhib iting prosperity. The land is generally tilled by the family and owned by the farmer, the women doing their share of the rough work. Their dress is picturesque a mixture of Oriental and European styles. Not a few women, however, in the southern districts wear what is but a slight modification of Turkish dress, with wide trous ers, a bolerolike bodice, and sometimes an overdress or a shawl of bright colors. Numbers of Servian girls dressed as men are joining the army in the field. Some of the Servian women are really beautiful. They are domesticated, good housewives and cooks. They are also very religious, and Ihe various feasts of the church are strictly observ ed.

Cherry City Patent and Economy Flour and also our Oregon Graham, in her demonstrations at the Armory this week. Make your next order in clude one of our brands at all Grocers. Cherry City Flouring Mills Capital Journal Better Foods, Better Homes school nt the Armory was a de cided success. Mayor Hurley O. White opened the school by introducing Mrs. Vaughn to tie large assembly of Salem house wives. Some remarkably beautiful decorated cakes by Mrs. Vaughn were awarded at the close of the session. Similar cakes arc to be given away each day. An interesting feature of Mrs. Kate B. Vaughns cookery course is the splendid collection of tested and ap proved recipes she gives her classes. The way Mrs. Vaughn handles her rec ipes and in fact her entire method of conducting the cookery class is heart ily approved of by those who attend, it is always a troublesome matter to write down the recipes ns dictated by the cookery teacher and I he housewife frequently finds when she conies to use these recipes as she has copied them they do not turn out just right and she realizes too late that she has mailt some slight mistake in putting down a figure orjias omitted one of the in gredients or in some way spoiled the recipe. In Mrs. Vaughn s school all this difficulty is obviated by tne cookery leaflet which she gives away to every woman who attends her school. Kncli day as the women enter the Armory they are presented with a copy of this leaflet. It contains the dishes Mrs. Vaughn demonstrate and when she be gins to prepare a dish she simply calls attention to the number of the recipe in the leaflet and the housewife is ab solutely certain when she goes home that she has a recipe exactly like the one used by the cookery teacher. Other recipes compiled by Mrs. Vnughn are published daily iu the Capital Journal. There is one in todays column for an exceptionally fine orange cake which will interest Salem housewives. Mrs. Vaughn points with pride to the fact that this is a womans world and a womans day. Business men and manufacturers, she says, must get cooperation of women. Housekeeping is coming into its own.

Impure, socalled looae milk, Is one of the most dangerous foods possible. In clean, pure, pasteurized milk we have the one perfect food for the hu man being, and the education of the consumer in the care of milk should go hand in hand with the Increased demands made on the milk farmer for a cleaner, higher grade of milk, and on the distributor for greater care in the handling of the product, bring ing it to your door clean and not con taminated with any bacteria which would cause disease. It is a well known fact that the average housewife, living in the town or city, knows comparatively nothing about the milk that is supplied to her family. She knows nothing as to where the milk comes from that is delivered at her door each day, and she knows almost as little about how the milk is cared for, once it has reached her refrigerator. If the housewife inspects her kitchen and refrigerator each day, she Bees in it a bottle of milk; pos sibly the milk may be in a bowl or pitcher but the chances are that nine times out of ten, whatever container the! milk is in, it is uncovered. The milk is left to absorb every odor from every particle of food in the ice box, which it does as greedily as a sponge absorbs water. If the milk is not in the ice box it may be left in a warm pantry or on the kitchen table uncovered. In the summer time it offers an ideal drink ing fountain for the typhoid fly, which is sure to haunt the kitchen of tho careless housewife. Or, if the city apartment house is the home, the milk reaches the kitch en by the dumb waiter shaft, or the servant elevator after it has been handled by any number of hands. niostIydIrfy. At one apartment which I once lived I was horribly shocked one morning upon opening the dumbwaiter shaft door to find my bottle of cream close ly nestled against a garbage can and the contents of many waste baskets from other apartments emptied around it. This was my first awakening as to the manner in which my milk was be ing delivered to me each morning. I perhaps had seen It at its worst, but it was the last time I saw it in this condition, for I Immediately made oth er arrangements for the delivery of my milk. Sometimes It takes a rude awak ening to bring us to our senses. If the tenement house flat is the home it may be left at the door of the poor woman if she can afford to buy bottled milk, where any stray cat or dog can Inspect it and then it Is open ed without washing the outside of the bottle. This was true last summer, when, riding early Sunday morning out into the country, all along the outskirts of the city, we notked bottles of milk standing on the porch, while the sun beating down upon them and within easy reach of any stray cats or dogs. Most of these were houses of appar ently a thrifty class, and if they had only thought of the danger their milk was subjected to, I am quite sure they would have found a place where the milkman could have left it In the shade and out of the reach of hungry animals. The careless handling of a product the most delicate is due to one of two causes either the housewife is indif ferent to the health of her family, or she is ignorant as to the effect of such careless handling of milk. One knows that no housewife could be indifferent to the health of her family; hence we must conclude that the careless handling of milk in the home is due to Ignorance. The champaign of education carried on through the recent milk shows has done more to educate the housewife and all other consumers of milk than tons of printed books on the subject. Of what use is it for the federal government to. enforce the pure food law, as it relates to mirk, or for the Individual state or for the city or the town to enact and enforce, at great expense, laws for the protection of the milk supply, or for the dairy farm er and the distributor of milk to ex pend large sums of money In produc ing and delivering a clean, pasteur ized, pure supply of milk, when the ignorant and Indifferent housewife, by her careless methods in the home, nullifies all the work done by the fed eral, state or municipal authorities and renders useless the time and money spent by the farmer and distributor of milk? In many a home milk is treated with as little care as a bag of potatoes. No pains and no expense should be spared to educate the consumer of milk; first as to its food value, sec ond as to the danger of contaminated milk from tubercular cattle, and third ar to its care in the home. If women were educated to appreci ate the food value of pasteurized milk, the campaign for its production would go forward by leaps and bounds. If consumers knew how dangerous to health Is the consumption of any other kind of milk they would with one accord demand the best product and willingly pay the increased cost if required. No matter how bad a man may be, there Is one woman who can find some good in him. Rouchefoucauld said that there are no pleasant marriages. But he had not tried them all. It Is easy to make a bad matter worse than It is to make a good mat ter better. We have enough unwritten laws; what we need is a few more unbroken ones. Fishing for husbands or fish is much the same. The big ones get away. Dont overstep yourself In trying to put your best foot forward. One right the taxpayer has is the right to pay the freight. M adam, Do Your Silks Give Positive Satisfaction?

	"DANGERS That Menace BEAUTY During March By Mme. Lina Cavalieri, the Most Famous Living Beauty. I F a pretty girl can weather the month of March and come out looking as pretty as before, or if a plain girl emerge on April first, looking no plainer than on March first, it is because she has taken March precautions. March precautions consist first in guarding with all possible care against sudden changes of temperature. The weather of this month is most variable, and the much talked of sudden changes are genuine menaces to the beauty of the complexion. Protect the face, then, by veiling it at this time of the year, if no other, from the raw winds. And when you come in from the raw, cold, outer air do not go directly to the radiator nor stove log fire to warm yourself. Better warm yourself gradually by slowly removing your wraps and walking about your room. When you sit down by the fire protect the delicate akin of the face from the direct heat rays, screening it from the fire by a fan or by one of the round, dainty painted fire screens held in the hand, that are among the coquetries of habit remaining from an age when they cared more for the little graces of life than they do to day. Use good preservative lotions and creams plenti fully at this season. This is the time of year when it is well to use the complexion mask to Insure the face plenty of moisture to offset the drying effect of the March winds. My complexion, deriving much benefit from glycerine, I often apply it by dabbing it plentifully upon the face and then place over the face a mask made of chamois. The mask helps the skin to perspire and the glycerine softens it, remov ing that withered look which March winds bring as surely as do the direct rays of the August sun. The mask is made from a square piece of chamois, which for a thin face is cut off just above the chin, so that the flesh about it will not be dissolved in the perspiration coaxed to the surface by the mask. Holes should be cut in the mask just above the eyes and one just over the nose, to permit free breathing. I place this upon the face w r hen I take my afternoon rest before singing or even at night upon retiring. When my skin needs whitening also I add to the glycerine lemon juice in the proportion of Glycerine, 3 ozs.; Lemon Juice, 1 oz. Some cannot use glycerine, as it proves too great an irritant for the skin. For such skins this is cooling, Whitening, and yet nourishing: Olive Oil, 3 oz*.; Lemon Juice, 1 oz.; Italian Pink, or Attar of Rotes, 6 drop. While at my cateau in France, where I could not readily secure cosmetics, I used the oldfashioned remedy of horseradish and buttermilk for livening and freshening and at the same time whitening the skin. Horseradish root, / z oz.; Buttermilk, / z pint. The horseradish root is shredded fine and left to How to Cook DASHEENS, the NEW VEGETABLE T HERE is a brand new, healthful and very appe tizing vegetable that may toon be within reach of everybody. It is called the dasheen, and, although it has long been used as a staple food by millions of people A Hill of Dasheens, Showing the Large Central Corm and the Tubers. Both of Which Are Good to Eat EASY TO MAKE— POPCORN BALL8. F EW sweets please children more then the oldfashioned popcorn balls, which ere not difficult to make. Two cupfuls of white sugar, with one cupful of water, onefourth cupful of vinegar and a piece of butter the size of an egg should be boiled together until mixture will crisp In cold water. The three quarts of freshlypopped corn (well picked over to remove all old maids—unpopped kernels) should be thoroughly mixed in and the balls formed. If it is desired to keep the balls some time they may be wrapped in squares of oiled tissue, the four corners tied with a bit of gaycolored silk thread. MAPLE CREAM CANDY. T HIS recipe requires the boiling together of two cupful* of maple sugar (or brown sugar with maple extract flavoring) and one cup ful of cream (one capful of milk with one teaspoonful of butter may be substituted tor the creem). It should be stirred constantly until It strings. Then two cupfuls of chopped nuts are stirred in and the kettle is removed st once from the Are. It is stirred then until almost too stiff to pour on the buttered plates. There is no occasion tor alarm If the milk curdles when It first begins to boil, tor It will become smooth again when it is cold. If variety is wanted, some of the candy may be made into little balls and dipped In chocolate, melted, after the balls are cooked. 10 of tropical and subtropical coun tries: it lias only recently been in troduced into the United States. The Government Bureau of Plant Industry, which makes a specialty of developing new varieties of food, or of promoting the introduction of foods into new places, has found out that the dasheen is well adapted to cultivation is most of the Southern States, and is urging farmers there to become better acquainted with it. The dasheen grows in hills— much as potatoes do. In fact, it resembles in many ways these uni versally popular vegetables. The plant develops long spherical corms and largs potatolike tubers, both of which may be used for food. The flesh of the corms and tubers when cooked is somewhat gray or violet in color. Although resem bling the potato in many respects, the dasheen has a more delicate flavor and one that is very pleasing to the palates. When uncooked dasheens are scraped they should be handled in water to which a level teaspoonful of washing soda or sal soda to the quart has been added, as the juice of the outer layer of the raw dasheen contains an irritant that, when mixed with water, causes the hands of many persons to sting. This property is destroyed by cook ing, the cooked dasheen being as bland as a potato and of a pleasant nutty flavor. CAVALIERI Explains How simmer for five or six hours at the back of the stove. It is then corked and kept in a cool place, and dabbed upon the face at night, being held in place by the mask. If you are so fortunate as to be able to get rain water or melted snow water at this time, a whitening and softening lotion can be made of Rain water, 1 pint; lemon Juice, 2 ozs. To make this more agreeable I always add a few drops of a favorite perfume, it may be hyacinth or violet or rose or carnation, as you like. to OArUjUARU Your GOOD LOOKS Through I must remind my readers at this time of the sum & mary a great physician once made of his science: Keep your head cool, your feet warm and your diges tion good. That is the whole of medicine. I have repeatedly told you that permitting the scalp to become overheated is as great an evil for the hair as lack of rain is to the droughtparched fields. The cool scalp is the one that grows long, thick and lustrous hair. March is the month of heavy colds, and colds cause feverish conditions of face and scalp. Avoid colds as you would a pestilence, for they are of the minor pestilences to beauty. OAVf",
	"The term, CoOperation, is much used and much abused. It is used more commonly now than ever before. It stands for good fellowship, helpful ness and increased efficiency It is abused by being used in connection with enterprises purely individual and selfish, and in group enterprises, the objects of which are entnely opposed to the general welfare. In Minnesota, however, cooperation among farmers is quite general, and is conducted usually along libeial and truly co opei ative lines. The old idea that farmers cannot work together has been proved entirely untrue Farmers can work together greatly to their own advantage, and to the disadvan tage of no other legitimate efficiently conducted business This statement is borne out by the 600 to 700 suc cessful, truly, cooperative creameries, numerous elevators, cheese factories, fire insurance companies, telephone companies, breeders, producers and marketing associations True GoOperation. The principles or cooperation are democracy, fairness and reward for efficient service. Democracy is se cured by granting to each patron and stockholder of the enterprise one vote, that is, men vote and control the undertaking, rather than allowing money to control, as is the custom in corporations Fairness is secured by paying only reasonable interest on capital stock, and declaring no divi dends on stock Money is entitled to a fair rate of interest and no more. It is patronage and good management that make a cooperative enterprise succeed, so management and patron age should receive the reward. Effi ciency is secured by paying good wages to the manager of the enter prise, and by returning all profits to the source that created them, namely, the persons who patronized the com pany and in exact proportion to their patronage. An Example. For a good example of true co operation, we may take a cooperative elevator, the capital stock of which we will assume to be $6,000. This elevator will handle 100,000 bushels of grain. The margin for handling may be 5 cents per bushel, or $5,000 The expenses may be estimated as follows: Salary of manager $1,000 Interest on capital stock at 7. 420 Repairs, equipment, etc 580 Incidentals, interest, insurance, etc 1,000 Ttoal expense $3,000 This will leave a profit on the years business of $2,000. Under a corporate organization this $2,000 would go to the owners of the stock in the form of 33$ per cent dividends Under the cooperative system, the $2,000 would be paid to the men who delivered the grain, on the basis of 2 cents per bushel for each bushel of grain de livered. Value of CoOperation. By A. D. WILSON, Director of Agricultural Extension Division, University Farm, St. Paul. Principles of Business. Business as now done requires large transactions for economy Buying in small quantities and selling in the same way are the chief factors in the excessive cost of distribution. Every instance where farmers or any other class of people have gotten together so as to buy or sell in large amounts, economies have resulted Compare, for example, the time required to churn the butter by hand in a com munity of 100 to 200 homes, with churning the same butter by power in a cooperative creamery. Compare the lack of uniformity of the homechurned butter with the uniformity of the creamerychurned product. Compare the advantages of marketing by one man of 30 tubs of neatly packed creamery butter fresh from the cooler, each week, with marketing 100 to 200 small lots of butter from as many farms by as many different people. Another example of the advantages of cooperation in marketing is found in selling uniform, high quality pota toes by the carload, compared to sell ing small lots of potatoes to a local buyer who knows that when he gets his several small lots together in the car they will not be uniform in type or variety. Live Stock Shipping. Still another most excellent example of the advantages of cooperation is found in the Live Stock Shipping As sociation. Under the old system of marketing live stock, one to three or more local buyers in each center have spent their time driving from farm to farm to buy stock. Each buyer must make enough to pay livery hire, and to get pay for his time. Still, the stock he purchased is no heavier or no better in quality for his visit to the farms. In fact, the time and expense incurred was a complete and useless waste. In addition to this waste, when it comes time to ship, a shipper must invest $1,200, more or less, in each car of stock, and take his chances on coming out right when sold.

In the first place, the farmers wife is a contributor to the income, she is a real earner This is not generally recognized, and usually a man, if asked the amount of his income, will tell you the amount which he earns. He will even object if it is suggested that his wife earnshe feels it a reflection upon his ability to support his fam ily But really, isnt the farmers wife earning9 value, for the farmer generally looks upon a wife as a necessity. Wherein does this value lie Does it affect the profits at the end of the year? Who does the cooking and housework which the wife would do9 The Wife as a Factor in Home Development (From a talk given in Duluth, Feb. 4, 1914.) By LOUISE McDANNEL. Conditions in the country are deter mined by the conditions in the homes. Conditions there depend largely upon the income, the way that income is expended, and the ideals and standards of the membeis of the family. Now, what part has the farmers wife in affecting these conditions? She must be of real Is it done for nothing? Is it as well done as the wife would do it9 Then surely the wife earns as much as would have to be paid hired help, and more if she is more efficient. What does it cost to get washing and ironing done in your community9 That amount must be added to the earnings of the housewife who does these things. Often she also does the sewing for herself and family, so she earns the wages of a seamstress. To put it in another way, is she takes cloth costing $5 and makes a dress in every way as good as one for which she would have to pay $12, she earns $7 Mind you, she doesnt save $7, she earns it. She really increases the value of the goods that much by her own work upon it. By the time she has made the clothes for herself and fam ily, she has earned a considerable sum. Similarly, the value of the labor ex pended in the preparation of meals may be estimated. If the housewife makes material worth 75 cents and prepares and serves a meal for five people in every way as good as one for which they would have to pay a dollar and seventyfive cents (thirty five cents each) she earns the amount of the increased value of the meal ovei the raw food materials. Her Position as Home Manager But the highestpriced work done by the housewife is home management the general planning and ordering of the many activities about the house She must decide what work has to be done and when, and how, what are the family needs along all lines, and how they can be satisfied with the money at her disposal. She must guard the health of her family, watching the sanitary conditions outside of the house as well as inside. She must take care of her children This work is to be compared with that of the fami man ager, and as he earns more than the day laborer, so does the home manager earn more than the wages of a cook or a seamstress If you were able to hire such services, what would be the cost9 In all cases the value of work varies as it is poorly done or well done The woman who desires to earn the most possible by her work in the home must be prepared to do it well. This means that she must have training for the work. If she is to feed her family satisfactorily and without undue ex pense, she must know the requirements of the human body, the various foods with which these needs may be met, and their cost. If she is to keep her family well, she must know the chan nels through which disease is liable to enter, and how to avoid it. She must know the dangers from flies, from bad drinking water, from un ventilated rooms, etc. These things and many others are being taught in courses in Domestic Science and Do mestic Art now given in so many schools. That such training is appreci ated is shown by the large number of students enrolled in the courses. Household Equipment. Besides training, the housewife should have mechanical equipment with which to work All farmers realize that it pays to have good mechanical contrivances for manual labor wher ever possible. It is good business to provide the proper equipment for the economy of labor in the home, for such equipment in the home does pay By its use, more may be accomplished in less time, and with less effort than is possible without it. This means in creased length of life for the mother, and greater happiness for the entire family. By reducing the drudgery and the hours of labor for the woman in the home, some of her strength and time is left to spend with her husband and children. Water under pressure takes first place among the socalled household conveniences which increases the effi ciency of the housewife. The pressure tank is probably most satisfactory in this climate, the water pumped by means of a windmill or gasoline en gine. This, with plumbing is not so expensive as might be expected, but (Continued on page 12)",

There is ono industry in Richmond, the importance of which is not thor oughly reallred by many residents of this city?the baking industry. In number of men employed, the bak eries of New York City rank fourth In the City Directory. The Industrial Di rectory of New York City, just issued by that department, states tnat there nro 34,000 factories in Greater New York, with 6S2,79t> employes. The clothing and millinery factories rnnk first In the number of peoplo employed, the metal Industry second, and paper poods manufacturers third. Then comes the baking: industry, in wiytoh more than 17,^00 people are einplojBl. While at the present time the bak eries of Kichmond do not occupy the same relative position as those in New York, still it is very evident from the rapid strides made by the bakers of tlxls city during the last ten years that It will not be long before this indus try takes its place among the foremost of Richmond. This fact is made possible by reason of the wonderful improvements made in the manufacturing, handling and sell ing of bakery products. Not many years ago most oakeries were located in cellars or small, unsanitary build ings, but when the idea was conceived to build a thoroughly modern and sani tary plant in the city of Richmond, thete came coincident with that idea the opportunity of placing the baking business on an equal footing with that of any other properly conducted indus try. The custom of baking bread at home has now almost become considered u. Southern failing rather than a South ern virtue. ficcause, with a thor oughly modern and sanitary plant in which bread is made, without hardly the touch of human hand, the old Idea of the unclean bake shop has been eradicated, and the objection to bakers products removed. Some six years ago the American Broad and Baking Company of Rich mond erected on J3ast Leigh Street a magnificent baking plant, modern in ?very respect. And during the past nix years this company has continually mado changes and improvements in order to keep their plant at all times f up to the last word In tKe bread manu facturlng perfection.

Richmond Is a process that cannot possibly bo carried on in the home; and Is one of the chief reasons why bakers break, when properly made, 1b more nutritious and digestible than that made at home. From tho steam room the pans are then taken and placed In white tiled ovens. The ovens are heated at 450 degrees Fahrenheit, and kept at a uni form temperature. No bread can ho proporly baked in an oven that is not heated to at least 450 decrees,* and this decree of tem perature cannot be obtained in tho or dinary kitchen stove. Here, then, Is a second reason why bakers bread is superior to the liomebaked variety.

The long drouth during the summer month ut short the prospects of a large ly increased corn yield that was expected to follow the heavy spring plantings. All cribs and houses to he ed for storing corn should to fewept clean with a good brush, ays A. F. Kidder, professor of agronomy. L. S. TT. Wire fcrushes that are used for remov ing old paint before putting on a new coat are good for this pur pose. After being thoroughly leaned the crib should be white, trashed inside and out.

Corn that is grown in fields near cribs and barns will usually t >e heavily infested with the wee ▼il. Such fields shonld he hoggedoff. Ninety per cent or tnore of the corn in Southern States is pulled and stored with the shucks on the ears. A tight fitting shuck affords excellent sleeping quarters for weevil, as it is difficult to fumigate such ears properly. Corn should be shucked in the field as it is gathered. It fcan then be easily fumigated with fcarbon hisulphide (10 to 15 |K>nnds to 1000 cubic feet of space In the crrb) when the weevils ap pear.—L. S. U.

The housewife is a patient, muscular woman who would rather do her own work than put up with the eccentrictes of the human butterfly known as the hired girl. Owing to the rapid age in which we are living, some hired girls are more eccentric than others, and insist upon sham pooing their hair or laying the foundation for a new dance frock on washday, thus compelling the housewife to perform a week3 work in four hours, besides feed ing a large voracious family. Housewives are born, not made. Thechief qualification of a good housewife is a willingness to work overtime and, if necessary, world Without end. In this respst the hired girl had a decided advant age over her employer. No hired girl can be signed by nowadays without a clause in the contract which pèrmits her to dress up in cream taffeta at two oclock in the afternoon and stroll on the ave nue until 5:30. Another clause specifies that any and all work of whatsoever kind and character, remaining unfinished at the afore said hour of two oclock, shall be performed without grumbling by the housewife, under penalty of being deprived of the companion ship of the party of the second part. This contract cannot be broken except by giving thirty minutes notice. _ The housewife has a pleasant round.of duties, and is allowed to secure quite a little sleep. Her work is varied in its nature, for she has three meals to get each day, and if any two of them are alike she will be ipeeted by a loud, masculine wail. Every once in a while there are minor, trif ling duties to engage the swift AutoIntoxication Causes Death do job know why you have side heada c h e , diabetes, neuralgia, rheu matism and liver or kidney troubles?

Y.—Adv. o That the hitherto despised goat may add materially in solving problems arising from war condi tions by increasing the milk and cheese production is the opinion advanced by H. L. Hoolister, puu lisher of § farm paper. Gover nor Lowden, of Illinois, is quoted as considering this theory sound. The keeping of a goat or two may become a popular way of (loin?: our bit in the world war as plant ing a war garden, according to Mr. Hollister, who says that even the dooryard or roadside may be profitably made to servj as a pasture for this animal. If you are a suburbanite, your goats will make you independent of the milk man and may enable you to slide safely through* tight times, re sulting from sickness or lack of employment.—Sabine Banner. 0*ildr#aOry FOURFOOTED FARM TRAC TOR STEPS RIGHT ALONG. In plowing and cultivating, a welltrained, intelligent team of horses means much to a farmer. Therefore it is not surprising that many agriculturists are slow in accepting the tractor, with its clumsy wheels and grinding mo tor, for such work. For these re luctant ruralists, however, a new kind of machine has been in vented. It is wheelless and comes as near being a fourlegged steel horse as anything ever conceived outside the realm of cartoondom. The ingeniousness of the con trivance makes it humorous. It has feet and legs as well as hips, knees, and ankles, and is designed to amble along as steadily as any sorrel team that ever pulled a disk. The chief difference in the arrangement of the pedal extrem ities o fthe machine and those of a fleshandblood draft animal, is that there are no forward and! hind legs.

You look at the housewife who has a place for her things, and these things in their places, and iyou find a woman who is system atic in her work, and when she needs anything she can put her hands on it in a moment. She plans and calculates whenever there is to be extra work, extra cooking, extra washing etc., and she knows beforehand just what there is to do, and whatshe wants to do it with. And this same womao^ so exact in her doings, gets more time to rest and read and instruct her children in the paths of righffcnd the social duties they owe to all.

BY BIDDY BYE Every time the housewife pays the meat bill she is convinced she must use more of the cheaper cuts. But what to ask for andliow to cook the meat so her family will not protest is often a big problem. For all practical purposes, says one of Uncle Sams cooking experts, it may be considered that the pro tein obtained from meat differs little either with the kind of meat or the cut. The maximum is in the porter house; the minimum is in the brisket of beef. But the PRICE of different cuts is significant. Women who buy the cheaper cuts need not feel that their families will be less well nourished. The method of cutting the sides of beef, veal, pork and mutton vary in different localities, and the names of the cuts likewise vary in different parts of the countryr Prices will warn which are. the prime cuts of a beef carcass. They are all the steaks and roasts adja cent to the backbone between the rump (16) and the chuck (2). These are the sirloin steaks (14), porterhouse 12), Delmonico or club steaks (11) , the prime ribs, first and second cuts (78J. The third cut (9) makes an excellent large roast Tha",

But now it is said Joseph A. Hol puch, one of the new members, has grabbed off a fat municipal contract in the way of the construction work on the new. municipal contagious dis ese hospital.

There may be nothing illegal about Holpuch getting the contract, said Aid. Charles B. Merriam, but it seems rather unethical.

	"Until quite recently this privilege has been denied the residents of the Northeast Section, due to a banana peel. Its a tact. A woman slipped on the skin of a specimen of that succulent fruit at one of the other markets and obtained a ver djct against the city for damages. The city fathers therefore determined thaTsuch an accident should not occur again, and, to prevent it, denied the farmer the privilege of displaying his vegetables and produce on the sidewalks at the newer estab lished markets. The consequence has been that for several bbKsctBt s5bV 9i tbbbbRbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbI HiiHpi .i$199HH bbbBFIKS JFmrpT bbbBbC jflCjS! t.LL ffiSwB mMtPMbbbmIbbbI BSxBBi?BBy.

PJjBBBBBKyaBBBBBBHhBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBr ?! 3S?P9BbBbBBBBbH lllilllHHBlHilllllllKiKIIIH Its Thoroughfares Teem With Thrifty Marketers 3 ears the women of the Northeast Section have been obliged 1o deal with retailers or middlemen instead of buying direct from the farmer. This has necessitated the paying of an extra profit, over and above the price of the farmer, to these retailers. nw this right of the farmer to bring the results of his toil direct to the housewife is restored. It should be a matter of great rejoicing to the thousands of women who run the homes of V aihington especially in the Northeast Section. As everyone knows the elimination of the middleman makes for lower prices. The new arrangement of Northeast Market, with its covered booths of the many farmers and produce raisers markets does just this. Eliminates the Middleman Conditions permitting the sale of vegetables, dairy products, eggs poultn, etc., direct from the farmer who ib the producer to the housewife who is the consumer, makes for economy and loner prices. When the farmer can sell his products on the cit curbstone direct to the women of the Capital he has but one price. When these products pas through the hands of a middleman or retailer an additional profit over and above the farmers original price must be paid by the consumer. In many instances products which can now be bought direct from the farmer have heretofore had to pass through the hands of several such middlemen, each one adding his own profit, until it is small wonder that the housewife has been dismayed at the increasing high cost of living. Under the restored conditions which now maintain at the Northeast Market the products of the rich fields of Virginia and Maryland are brought right to the consumer without any middle man adding a cent to the cost. Eggs, fresh from the chicken houses, spinach, new potatoes, corn, tomatoes, home dressed meats, country butter, and the hundred and one toothsome and necessary foods of the farms are brought to the housewife at a single cost the price the farmer has earned for raising them. Another most important advantage that the housewife gains by patronizing the farmers and stalls of the Northeast Market is that of having her products absolutely fresh. Two Hours From Country to Kitchen Crisp, fresh vegetables with the morning dew still shining on them are displayed in pro fusion. In baskets and boxes, in wagons and stalls, on the curb and inside the market the greatest variety of choice fresh vegetables and fruits, with all of the zest that only absolute freshness can impart are arrayed at temptingly low prices for the women of the homes to pick and choose. This is recognized as both a morning and evening market. The wagons and baskets, crates and boxes laden with the choicest products of the fertile farms of Maryland and Virginia crowd the entire market place with their profusion. The pleasing aroma of fresh cut fruits and vegetables the smell of the real country hovers over the place and makes marketing a real pleasure aside from its more utilitarian idea of economy. The farmers bring their products straight from the fields and orchards direct to the market where the women can select them. The result is in many instances that but a few hours elapse betwen the time when the produce was picked and the time when it is ready for the table. Indeed the Northeast Market places the whole of the surrounding farm district right at the door, of the thrifty housekeeper. It is her garden patch where she can cull the choicest fruits and vegetables almost at first hand. Before she rises in the morn ing the farmer and raiser of country produce has been up, aroused by the crowing of the cock, and busied himself with cutting and plucking his produce in the wee sma  hours of the morning and has brought it in, eight or ten miles, to the city.

Daily the health inspectors visit it and they willingly admit that there is not another market in the whole city of Washington which surpasses it in cleanliness. Inside the spacious stalls with their white tile fronts show at a glance that there is not a speck of dirt that can mar the taste, smell, or purity of the products. The pictures give a faint idea of the invitingly clean appearance of the market inside and out. wvmmjrmtr Many Modern Improvements The Northeast Market has done everything to encourage the farmers with their produce who attend the market Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Every facility for the proper display and protection of the foodstuffs is offered them.

Note the Sanitary Tiled Counters Though the farmers have been at the Northeast Market for but a few weeks they are already loud in their praises of it. Maqy of them have here tofore been going to other markets in the city for as many as fifteen years. There they had built up a clientele of steady trade that they had to forsake in coming to the Northeast Market, yet many of them claim that they are here doing double the business they did elsewhere. The housewives appreciation is best demonstrated by the pictures. Foods Protected From the Suns Glare By Awnings A permanent awning has been erected which protects both the purchaser and the products from the glare of the sun and inclement weather. Many extensive improvements have been made in the market, among which is the removal of the wood benches and the installation of sanitary white tile stands. As will be noted further, the white tile refrigerator, only one in the cit, is at the Butter and Creamery Stand. The company has ",
	"A10 News of the Mines and Oil Fields COPPER MARKET YET UNSETTLED GENTLEMENS AGREEMENT WILL NEVER BE REACHED EIGHT.CENT PRODUCERS STAND IN WAY Grant Sees in Situation Only Dlsapj pointment for Small Producer Should Issue Carry—No Merger Probable The socalled gentlemens agreement between copper producers now being discussed in New York with a view to regulating the market for the metal will never become effective according to Robert ]>. Grant, president of the American Mines and Exploration com pany, who has Just returned to Los Angelas after spending four months in the east. Mr. Grant and his asso ciate, Philip Wiseman, promoted the Ray Consolluated ami Gila Copper properties in Arizona, and recently dis posed of their interests for a sum in excess of $1,000,000 cash in a private sale to Bernard M. BaniCß of New York. Regarding the copper situation, said Mr. Grant yesterday, I do not look for a combination of Senator w. A Clark, PhelpsDodga and the Calu met and Hecla as going into any merger. , As for the socalled gentlemens agreement as discussed In New York, such a proposition would not carry for the reason that a producer of the metal around 8 cents laid down in New York would not feel like curtail ing in order to help out the other fel low whoso cost was around 11 cents a pound. 5 Decision Affect* Plans There were all kinds of««tor1< go Ing about in New York concerning the merger and who would go Into It and upon what basis, but the recent decis lon against the Standard Oil changed a good many plans among: the copper people who were trying to get together. There Is at the present time quite a large copper surplus and all the mines seem to be working to nearly full ca pacity. The consumer Is buying only from one to two months ahead, M It would seem that there must come be fore long come kind of a combination by which production of the metal can be regulated. Every business bark east peetni bet ter and healthier, excepting the copper business, which I think Is due to the new porphyry properties sending Into the market a lot Ofcopper at low cost in addition to a very large output from the old mine.. We have nil been disappointed that »the railroads have not gone ahead with the electrification of their lines as planned several years ngo. This advancement has been held up by panic, but as business improves electrical power will no doubt be util ized by most eastern railroads. When this change la finally made the pur plus of copper will be quickly wiped out. While enst Mr. Ornnt and family toured all through New York nnd the New England states In his automo bile. The country there. Is very beauti ful In the autumn, says Mr. Grant, but no place looked half .1 good as Los Angeles and we are all mighty glad to get back. One hears a great deal of favor able talk In the east about Southern California and especially this city, and this winter should witness a large In flux of visitors from that part of the nation.

	"Penny Pinching Not Always True Economy The housewife schooled in really scientific domestic economy no longer throws away a nickel to save a penny. A good way to illustrate this would be through a comparison of the wholesome ness, efficiency and economy of a plain flour and a standard baking powder and a socalled self rising flour. It doesnt pay to buy selfrising flour. Most of it is made, of low grade materials. It causes many bakeday failures and a great loss of expensive baking ingredients. x The housewife will throw out in wasted materials many times the amount she hopes to save. Beside, self rising flour has a tendency to get lumpy and thats another waste. But what is most important, the housewife gets less in return as far as food value is concerned than if she purchased a plain flour and a standard baking powder. ; True economy in baking powder de mands the highest quality at the lowest price. A Baking Powder made only of the highest class ingredients obtainable, so skillfully and accurately proportioned that it not only pro duces the maximum of leavening power but conserves that power, retains its strength and is unfailing in results, is economical in cost and use. The housewife saves when she buys it. She saves when she uses it and she saves the materials with which it is used. That is economy in its highest form the only kind of economy the housewife should attempt to practice. American Red Cross Dietitian.

	"FIRE INSURANCE REPORT. Wo have received from the National board of fire underwriters of New York tho report for December, 1009, of insurance conditions in Salt Lake City. This report is decidedly not flattering from ilia insurance standpoint; but it must bo remembered I hat. tho data and the criticisms are based upon any lapse from a perfect condition, and as Salt Lake City is not. perfect from tho fire insurance standpoint, the criticism is, as largely expected, routine. Thero is ample water,, to bo sure, and for Hho most part the hydrants are sufficiently largo and numerous, especially in the business part of town; and yet the tiro eouipment is not. fully up to dale nor in quantity as much as tho insuranco perfection requires. The forco is criti cised somewhat from tho political standpoint:; which is more academic than . actual; and thoro is declared to be an insutncioul number of men, which is no doubt true from tho standard of perfection standpoint of tho insurance companies. There is pretty severe censure of our fire box system, but that censure is based on a condition of neglect which existed in the early pari, of tho sum mer, and which has been corrected since, but; wo depend principal ly on tho telephono for firo alarms, so tho disuse of tho tiroalarm boxes is not so ma terial. But tho correction should have been noted instead of allowing tho roport of tho original bad condition to stand unrelieved. In tho general sum mar, tho water situation and its man agement, aro pronounced efficient and generally satisfactory. Tho firo ap paratus is pronouueed generally in good condition, but in minor equipment de ficient. Tho inspection is fairly satis factory, but tho building laws are of littlo value, most subjects of import ance being omitted. which is rathor a startling thing to say and unfair, as a matter of fact, to tho ordinanco as passed. Additional condemnation is made by saving structural conditions aro unsatisfactory on account of poor building laws. It is further stated that no provision is mado for prose cution of arson, which is nonsenso. Tho general statute is ample for such prosecution, and thero could bo no municipal ordinance that would reach the case. Any expectation based on the idea that prosecution for arson could bo conducted under city ordin ances is erroneous. The general effoct of tho report is rather confusing on tho whole, unless wo keep strictly in mind the idea ihat this report is made from the stand point of idoal insuranco conditions un der which fire is practically impos sible, and in which case, of course, there need bo no bother about insuring at all. The ideal condition from tho fire insuranco standpoint would neces sarily defeat its own cause, for if wo had it nobody need bother about insur ing anjthing. At the same time that there is much criticism of tho city from the lire in surance standpoint, thero is an admis sion of general results hero which is certainly very satisfactory, and miti gates almost entirely the force of tho criticism. The report sa3s (on tho soc ond page): The prross fire loss for the past five years, as Klven in tho reports of the chief of the lire department, amounted to S3S4.78G, the annual losses varying from ?1.11 In 1304, to $132,303 In 1007. and the number of fires from 187 In 1901, to 321 In 1008. Tho loss per fire has averaged 5321. and the yearly number of firoa 240. Based on an average population of 72,000. tho average number of fires per year for each 1,000 population was 3.32, and the average annual loss per capita $1.07, a low figure. With resulls like that, the insurance companies ought certainly to bo con tent, especially when wo consider the probability (the segregation of tho city premiums paid from thoso paid ;u the state at largo not being required by law) that they undoubtedly receive iroble (and perhaps more) tho amount of money in premiums over the total amount of firo losses. So that on tho whole, even from tho insuranco stand point, thn city of Salt Lake ought to be considered qn the average a mighty good fire risk. FULL CORROBORATION. During tho courso of the controversy between this paper and the Doserct News over tho assassination of Joseph and Ilyrum Smith, wo at ono time print ed part of a statement mado by Cath erine1 Smith, who was a sister of the two murdored men. Wc now havo that statement in fuller form, tho addi tional matter having been inacccsiblo lo us upon tho former occasion. As a means of more fully informing tho pub lic in this matter, wo reproduce this more complete statement, as follows: I was In Nauvoo a few days before my brothers were brought to Carthagu, where they met their death. I shall never for pet that Saturday, June 23, 1811, when I last saw my brothers alive. Joseph had preached a sermon lo tho largest crowd I have ever scon. It was his last sermon.1 1 might say. that It was more In the nature of a prophecy than a ser mon, for ho said, turning on the plat form where he stood and facing some of thr high prlosts and elders sitting there: There arc those among you who will betray mo soon; In fact, you have plot ted to deliver mo up to thn enemy lo be slain. Tho truth of this prophecy Is of history. Ho was betrayed, and by his own alleged best friends. Theso same fellows attempted to assume the reins of the church at his death. They not only attempted this, but thoy attempt ed to Introduce obnoxious teachings into tho church. My ncphow, the present Jo seph Smith, president of tho Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints at La monl, Iowa, Is the truo and only succes sor of Joseph Smith, tho martyr. It is unnecessary to mnko comment upon this matter; and it is morely pre sented lo further prove our contention that it was plotting and intrigue among tho Mormon priesthood , that brought about the death of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, just as wohavo all along contended, and proved by the best au thorities, and which contpntion tho Deseret News has persistently denied. As to who was entitled to lead tho church after tho death of the Smiths is none of? our concern, but is a matter to be decided between the contending factions themselves upon personal be lief. And yet it may be well, oven upon this matter, to refer to Whitneys His tory of Utah, because, possibly, the question of leadership may havo played a part in tho conspiracy to removo Joseph. In volume 1, on page U32, that work says: Of tho nbsent. Apostles. Parley P. Pratt was tho first to return to Nauvoo. Ueorgn A. Smith came next. Sidney P.lgdon ar rived a little later from Pittsburg. Brig ham Young, Hobcr C. Kimball, Orson Ilvde, Orjon Pratt. Wilford Woodruff arid Lyman Wight, who woro in tho Eastern States when tho tcrrlblo tidings reached them, returned to Nauvoo on the Uth of August, forty days after the massacre. Immediately aflcr this scramble for home ihero was a hot row on among all tho leading men of tho church, and be tween factions of tho saints themselves, as to who was to gel. the plum of lead ership. Plots and counterplots wore laid and executed. The community was  rent  with strife and un rest and .uncertainty pervaded the homes of tho people. But in the end Brigham executed a coup detat that completely shut out his ecclesias tical competitors. As tho head of the twelvo ho called a meeting in tho Nauvoo temple, stationed a lot of his supporters out in tho audience, and be gan, an impassioned speech. When the people were worked tip lo a high pitch of excitement his emissaries slolo quiet ly to ono and tho other, saying, Look! tho mantlo of Joseph has fallen upon Brigham! Dont you see? Thero is Joseph back again! Brigham is our leader! And Brigham won out. RAYNERS HOT ROAST. Sonator Rayncr has administored to Zela3a a roast about as hot as any which history records against a de generate ruler. TC ho were simpty a highwayman, says Senator Kayncr, wo might identify him; if ho were simply a tyrant, who oppressed the peo ple for tho purposo of robbing them, wo might particularizo him; if ho were a usurpor, who was only holding onto power so long as there was jlny money in tho treasury to stoal, orany further territory that ho could sack for private plunder, we could assign him a proper placo in tho ranks of somo of his prede cessors, and if ho were purely an as sassin, who regarded murder as a legiti mate profession through which he could despoil his victims of their possessions until the time came for him to flee from the hands of rctributivo ;justieo, it would bo easy also for anyone ac quainted with the political history of Nicaragua lo classify him. Ho is, however, all of theso things combined1. In the school of corruption, dishonor, perfidy and crime ho stands without a peer, and exhibits in ono glow of associated harmony the pride of every model and tho perfection of every master. And Mr. Rayner conliuucs that ho has been roliably informed. .that, .tho vices of his private lifo arc moro in famous in their indescribable dolails than tho iniquities of his public ca reer. Justly, therefore, he concludes that such a creature as this desorves the oxecration of mankind. Applying tho arraignment mado to the caso in hand Senator Raynor said: Now. as the culminating infamy of his administration, trampling upon every In stinct of humanity. In violation of univer sal law, In defiance of those precepts of the International code that havo been rec ognized ever since tho night of barbarism receded before the rays of civilization, ho has put to torture and then to death two American citizens who were not guilty of treason, who woro not spies, but whom ho had captured as prisoners of war In the army of the revolutionists. This act was not only tho act of a fiend, but was an Insult to tho honor of this republic, and cannot remain una venged. It Is absolutely preposterous for us to talk about Indemnity. Indemnity Is in recompense for murder. It Is said we ought to break off official communication with his accredited representatives. Wo have already done that and that amounts to nothing and Is a matter of absolute unconcern to him. Then It Is said wo ought (o declare war against Nicaragua. 1 think that Is unnecessary. This government Is a cowardly govern ment If It docs not make an example of Zelnya before the eyes of the civilized world. This case will not admit of any trilling or concessions. If two American citizens havo been murdered by Zelnya, then he must bo made lo pay tho pen alty of his crime. Once spread before tho American peo ple the details of the execution and our people will rise In arms and demand retri bution. They have not yet fully absorbed the significance of this deed. All of which is mighty vigorous talk, decidedly stirring to tho Amorican heart. And yet tho question must nat urall ariso, what; interest, the United Slates has in its allogcd citizens who enter the service of somo foreign power and meet their death either barbarously or othcrwjso while in that service. If wc extend the protection of our citi zenship to persons who havo abjured that citizenship by entering tho scrvico of other nations, or of thoao who would obtain powor in othor nations by insur rection or treason, than that is a prin ciple that is to bo onforcodnoL only as against Nicaragua, but as against any other nation or power. And if it is good international law, aro wo pre pared to enforce it, say against. Great Britain, Prance, German, or Russia? If wo aro, all right. If wo aro not, do not lot us mako bombastic bullies of ourselves by assorting it against weak and puny Nicaragua, when wo would not assert it agninst another nntion, ono of our own size. THE INTOLERANT SPIRIT. Wo vory often hear from the Deseret News concerning the spirit of tolerance that was exercised toward inhabitants of this valley when tho Mormon lead ers were in complotc control hero. Let us cito an cxamplo of it. Wc find it; in a sermon delivered by President Brigham Young at the timo tho south cast corner stono of tho Salt. Lake tem ple was laid and dedicated. It is in tho Journal of Discourses, volumo 2, pago 33, and roads as follows: We do not wnnL any whlnors about this temple. If you cannot commence cheerfully, and go through tho labor of the whole building choerfully, start for California, and tho quicker tho better. Heretofore wo havo quoted tho un polile invitations extended to Gentiles and apostates, by Prosident Young and llebor C. Kimball, that if thoy did not like I he oneman domination that ex isted hero, or objected to the manner in which things wore run, they could get out, and do it allfired quick. And hero, now, wo see (hat the same spirit of intolerance wns exhibited to ward even the Mormon poople, pro vided any of thorn disliked to bo im poverished for the purposo of construct ing an edifice in which thoy could be mado io swear vongeanco against, the United States, and submit themselves lo an agreement lo suffer the most cruel tortures and death in the evonl IhnL they divulged tho secrets thorcin confided to their keeping. Between ono thing and nnothor, it was a rathor jolly lifo that both Gen tiles und Mormons led horc in tho early days; and it goes without saying that if the power were possessed by tho presentday hierarchs the danco would be proceeding at a still livelier paco today. THE RULE OF THE ROAD. Tho Tribuno has been frequent in urging the rulo that persons mooting on the sidewalks should always turn to the right. This for tho purpose of convenience, uniformity, and to pre vent confusion and collisions. A cor respondent calls attention to this, and asks us to explain on that basis tho following despatch from Paris which appoarod in tho New York Timos: PARIS. Nov. 19 Pending tho time whon special njotor roads aro expeeied to form a network over Franee, a Par liamentary committee is busy drawing up a rulo of the road for tho country. Each Department hitherto has seemed to possess Its own rule, while In Paris no rulo is observed or enforced at all meeting vehlelos turning to tho right or left as Is most convenient for them. Tho plan of the committee Is to adopt the English system of keeping to tho left. This plan, which, as Americans will on sorve. Is the opposite of the rule fol lowed In tho United States, has tho ap proval of M. Millcrand, the Minister ot Public Works. Arguments In favor of the ICeop to tho Left rulo take the following shape: Tho English rule of proceeding to the left Is founded upon logic and good sense, and Is the result of tho experi ence of a pcoplo habituated to horses. The fact that a driver keeps to the left of Ih road and yet sits over the right wheel of his vehicle gives him a belter chance of steering, with a wider margin of safety, than the man who keeps to the right, and cannot. In conscouenco. gee how far oft he Is from Ills neighbors wheel. The advantago Is, also, to the English system In passing to the offside of a vehicle. Tho Keep to the Right style Is condemned because of tho dan ger to which It exposes the man who Is leading a horse. Tho driver of tho fast moving vehicle Is unable to see the man on foot until ho is right upon him. There havo been a large number of fatal acci dents for tills very reason on French roads. Meanwhile, It would bo Interesting to learn Just how tho Keep to the Right rule camo to bo established In the United States. Wns It Invented by tho colonists or did It becomo tho fashion as a sort of autlBrltlsh demonstration at tho time of the American Hovoltulon? Tho correspondent will note that tho Paris despatch noted refers to tho rule of tho road in driving horses or motor vohiclcs. It is, as staled, an awkward thing for thoso sitting on tho right and meeting a vehicle on tho rond to turn lo the right. Tho natural thing is for them to turn to the left, so that the driver can tho moro clearly seo tho spaco between his own vohiclo and tho ono he is meeting. This should havo been tho rulo in this country as well as in England. But tho rule of tho road for pedestrians is tho re verse of that for vehicles. Tho colon ists to this country from Groat Britain brought with them the rulo of tho pedes trian, which is to turn to the right. This from immemorial usage. Corre spondingly, they ought to havo brought with them the rule to turn to the left in driving, but thoy did not. On tho contrary, they seemed to consider that tho same rulo should apply to driving as to walking. It docs hot logically ap ply at all. Quito tho roverse. It would bo better if wo had hero a rulo to turn to tho left in driving all kinds of vehi cles, including automobiles. It is too lato now, however, to undertake to chaugo that tuIc. In France, as noted in tho despatch, thoro is great confusion, ono province followiug the one rulo and another tho other rule. In Paris thero is no rulo at. all. Tu seeking uniformity, there fore, the French authorities aro natural ly and logically following the rulo to tho left, in driving vehicles. Wo should bo glad if that custom had boon trans mitted to us from Great Britain. It is logical, convenient, and in every way reasonable. But wo dont havo it; and anjhow it has nothing to do with tho rule of pedestrians, which is in Eng land, as horc, to turn to tho right, and that is whufcwo aro endeavoring to iu culcato on our sidewalks. It is tho rule of gonoral application for those who walk, and it ought lo bo observed by ovorybody. Tho pedestrian in old times carried his shield on his left arm, and it was, a dofonse when ho walked in placo to tho right; but if ho wero bent on attack ho moved lo tho loft, so as to givo play to his right arm. Cor respondingly, the knightly horsoman was a man of war, always belligerent, and was bound to pass to tho left, in ordor to givo play to his lance. And tho men of war, whether afoot or on horsoback, laid down the law. It is observed that tho Dcsorot News prints a long editorial article on tho subject of denatured alcohol. Certain exports in criminology might sug gest to Cho church organ the pertinence of a pious dissertation upon the sub ject of denatured polygamies. A reported jewelry theft ih New York seems to bo regarded by tho police in the samo light as tho story of the man who blows his wnges and then ( tolls his wifo ho wns hold up. It is not so much that the small bpy dislikes school, ot course, as it is that ho has heard so much about so many great men having started out in lifo without education.

	"Hi UNCLE 5An3 CHEESE BOOK FOR MRS. HOUSEWIFE (Editors note: Uncle Sam thinks we are not eating enough cheese. It is his idea that with more cheese on the family table we will wax richer in pnrse and fatter of body. The department of agriculture has prepared a cheese book, pointing out the value of cheese to the inner man, and giving many cheese dishes. These wilL appear from day to day in The Day Book under the title UncIe.Sams Cheese Book.It will pay you to cut them out each day and paste them in a small blank book for future refer 1 ence. By Uncle Sam. Cheese is used in general in two ways in small quantities chiefly for its flavor, and in large quantities for its nutritive value, as well as its flavor. Those which are used for their flavor, many of which are high priced, contribute little to the food value of the diet, because of the small quantity used at a time. They have an im portant part to play, however, in making the diet attractive and palatable. Those cheeses which are suit able to be eaten in large quanti ties and which are comparatively low priced, important for their flavor and nutritive value as well, are known to the trade ..stand ard factory cheese, and to the American housewife as American cheese. It is the regular, round cheese of the grocery store. This particular variety is referred to when the word cheese is used without specification in the reci pes to follow. Cheese has nearly twice as riiuch protein, weight for weight, as beef of average consumption and its fuel value is more than twice as great. It has a larger per cent of both, protein and fat than steak, eggs, potatoes, milk, or bread, and therefore is one of the very best foods that you can have on your table. Cheese does not cause constipaj tion or other physiological dis turbances that have erroneously, been charged to it. When cheese takes the place of meat as the central dish of a meal, the housewife should have fresh vegetables or fruits as a contrast to the concentrated and fatty cheese. Harder kinds of bread should be used, such as crusty rolls, toast, rye bread, the harder brown bread or crackers. CHEESE SAUCE One cupful of milk, 2 table spoonfuls of flour, 1 ounce of cheese ( cupful of grated cheese), salt and pepper. Thicken the milk with tKe floor",
	"it measures such as pounds, quarts, or pints. These packages bear no statement of weight or measure and probably are not sold by weight or measure, but they give an impression to the customerof a certain definite quantity. The housewife will gain great profit by inquiring just how much pack age goods she is receiving and she wijl often be surprised. The housewife should beware of the fluffy ruffles variety of foodJThere is a tendency to puff Up everything that is made to make it big in bulk while at the same time it is light in weight. Bottles are thicker than is neces sary for safety and the dent in the bottom sometimes extends alH most to the center. Cereal foods are flaked or rolled so as to ac cupy an immense bulk with light weight and while there may be no intention of deception there exists a general impression of re ceiving more than one gets.

Two lit tle Titanic orphans, saved with a lap dog, and wholly uncon scious of the tragedy of their lives, are playing today at the home of Miss Margaret Hays. No one knows who they are, nor where their honie is. No ope knows if they have any living rel atives. They are just two little Waifs of the greatest sea disaster of history. The older is about four years old, a curlyhaired, brighteyed, little Frenchman, who spends most of his time trying to amqse his two year old companion. The other may be his brother, but no one knows for certain whether or no he is. Margaret Hays was saved on the last lifeboat to leave the Ti tanic. The boat had been lowered into the water, the crew were prepar ing to pull off, when a wild cry came from the deck of the sinking ship. A Frenchman, ,carrying two naked babies in his arms, ap peared at the rail. He shouted to the crew of the lifeboat, crying to them to save the babies ; then hurled the older one into the outstretched arms of a sailor. Wfth the tears streaming down his face, murmuring prayers, he hugged the younger baby to his breast, smothering its facewith a last farewell kiss. Then he tossed him, too, to safety.",
	"THE MUNICIPALHOUSEWIPET TT1 The stockyards at Chicago, with its 10 square miles of filthy yards and alleys and its streets half the time under water, was about the meanest proposition in the way of street cleaning ever offered a ward superintendent. It was clearly a job for a hardheaded, practical man who could deal firmly with rough necks and didnt mind bad smells. But Miss Anna Murphy, young and good looking, got the job. She has passed the civil service examination and there was no denying her. A good many people thought that was pushing the new woman idea just a trifle beyond the limit of common sense. Anna Murphy didnt think so. , She had a meager appropriation, but like a good housewife she made it go around. First she cleaned up the alleys, then white washed the fences, next established and strictly enforced .regulations to care for garbage. Finally she piled the refusefrom the alleys in the watersoaked streets, and had it covered with ashes and gravel before it was aware of it, and the stockyards district had a beauti ful new highway built without cost as anincident to cleaning up. the ward. Now Chicago is wondering if the, municipal housewife is the next thing in order, and if the ward politician street superintendent is about to go on the garbage pile himself.

DILIGENCE ^ BUSINESS. Spring?beautiful spring ?is now opening | upon us, inspiring our hearts with joy, af'er the dullness of winter. The ?tor:ii king has retired far to the north, and carried with him his chilling blasts, his snows, and cold. We begin life anew, as it were, under the milder administration of the genial and pleasant sea son. This is an excellent time to enter upon and prosecute new plans for the good of our fiellow men. Forrthis we live?to honor our Creator and bless those around us. The most effectual way to accomplish this laudable end, is to first be assured that our employments tend towards it, and then, with all possible diligence, to pro ceed in our work. We shall not detain our readers here to investigate the question, What business in life best answers the purposes of usefulness? Suffice it for us to lay down this general principle, that each individual is held responsible for the settlement of this inquiry himself. Every man can easily determined with whether-his present occupation in life benefits his race or not; and is bound, if it does not, to forsake it at once. any one lives to himself alone, he is doing wrong; and though he may t drive off the solemn impressions, which come upon him, of the impropriety of his course, until he completely fixes himself in a fearful contentment to continue in a business not adapted to the glory of God, or the good of man; yet he will find, in the end, hat he had far better have yielded to his conscientious convictions on this subject, and pursued some more laudable employment during his stay on earth. A Desiring their, that each one carefully ex amine himself in relation to his avocation, we proceed to urge all to diligence. Be active; expect not to succeed without attention to this injunction.  By industry we thrive; with-! ou^ it we fail. Aim high. Endeavor earnest ly to be at the head of the list of those engaged in your business. This is a laudable ambition. Enterprizing men are useful men; the sluggard is a drone?yea, worse than a drone; he does nothing himself, and is in the way of others. Upj therefore, ye who would honor your name, and load your fellow creatures with benefits ; up, and after the example of God himself, be active?be diligent. Do not seek to raise upon the ruins of others; but spare no pains to show that you wish to excel them, while you are willing that they, too, should strive to excel you. Now is your time for renewed exertions, to live to good purpose?begin with the spring of the year, to spring forward into new life and increased usefulness. Such a course will bring upon you the approbation of all the good , and the signal blessing of Him who truly helps those who help themselves.  If I were but a shoe-black, said one,  I would', at least, stfive to be the best shoe black in London.The idea is a good one ; adopt it, and  go a head. Professional men, merchants, mecha nics, farmers, one ^nd all, heat us?our advice to you, this day ts worth your attention?do not forget-H. Be diligent in business; likf the stream whloli' issues from the Fountain, roll on your exertions to excel in doing good ; (of, however smalt you may suppose your influ ence to be, if you are engaged in a laudable bu siness and follow it well, you will.be a blessing to all around you.

The worthy clergyman suddenly stopped in the midst ol the argumentative portion of his sermon, an^ gazed earnestly upon a certain pew. The con gregation did not know what to make ol it} but the pastor finally resumed, and went on with his discourse until another, and another, long pause caused the curiosity bump to swell almost to bursting. What could be the matter? Had the Rev. gentleman lost a few leaves of ? his sermon, or?but no matter, he ended the painful suspense, by declaring if any indivi dual desires a copy of my sermon, I will, with pleasure, comply, but I do protest against any person taking notes of it. Here the mystery was explained, and all eyes were turned to wards a poor unfortunate son of Adam in a j distant pew who was reclining upon his arm,, asifsurreptitiously placing upon paper words that burn. The officers of the church ap proached him without delay, when behold, the man was fast asleep, and was no doubt dream ing of whole rows of unmended 6hoes and boots, for he was a poor honest shoemaker, I who could not take a short hand note, if the whole of Oregon depended upon it. At the basement of the Capitol yesterday, was exhibited a very ingenious washing ma chine invented by Mr. Tippett of this city. The wheels are propelled by steam from a very I ^mall boiler, which is warranted not to burst, j It is well worth the attention of all lovers ol clean clothes. He has also another patent ma chine for preparing hominy. Mr. W. Stewart has opened a store a few doors, below our office, where soda water of j the best quality can be had to wash down the I dust of the avenue. He has also for sale a hun dred other useful articles, among which is Sear's family library. A few days since, a gentleman from Virgt nia, while listening to a debate on the floor ol the Senate, lost a pair of new gloves. He re. marked to the Senator who introduced him, that he had no doubt the gloves had been ta ken by a couple of old codgers who had stood near him. On being requested to point them out, the said old codgers proved to be the British Minister and Gen. Scott. Thp Joint Committee of Conference on the Oi??zon resolutions, made no report yesterday. It is said the House will recede from its amend | ment. THE HOGS' LAMENT. Mr. Ward, with your consent, We will make known the hogs lament; We do not wish to censure men, But merely strive to clear our pen Krom foul aspersions cast upon us By those who take our freedom from us : Men cry a nuisance is at large, And straightway give their agents charge, To scour the town through every street, And pick up all the hogs they meet. J\o sooner said than 'us performed ; Each alley, lane, and gutter's storm'd : Pigs, dogs and men start in the race, And boys and women join the chase, j 'Twere well if u?e were blest with shanks As long as men's who rob the banks; Then might we stop and take our wind. And laugh at what we've left behind, And bless the law that can't perplex us, When we are safely moored in Texas: But we poor creatures must submit, The dogs come up, our ears are bit? We strive in vain their hold to break? We pull, they tug, we squeal, they shake. Our masters hear our mournful cries, And quick each to our rescue flies. At first they scold, then calmly reason, The officers cry treason, treason. 'I'ween man and dog, in the affray, Our ears and tails are torn away. Now, Mr. Ward, we do declare Such treatment is too hard to bear: We do not wish to break the law , We'd rather wnh the coarsest straw From day to day our bodies cram. Than suffer pain from policeman But what can we do when af home?? From week to week there's not a bone To grease our snouts, ('.parched like a brick,) And there's our mistress with a stick ?  Out, out, you brutes?away, she'll cry :  Fish for yourselves?' root, hog, or die.' GftVKTER. Gapitol Hill. NEWS HY THE CALEDONIA.

The European Times says,  the commer cial accounts from all parts of the county, are desponding and gloomy. And again,  the gloom which hangs over business has bttn gradually deepening for six weeks?the last fortnight being darkest of all.The Cotton market is, especially, depressed; and the Money market in a very unsatisfactory state.  Cash is scarce and dear, and nothing but first rate paper, at short dates, stand the least chance of discount at London.Indian corn is becoming exceedingly popu lar, as an article of food, among the British. The following is a jrart of a fine article con cerning the termination of the war in India, from Wilmer's Times: The result is, in many respects, gratifying. The honor of our arms has been brilliantly maintained, and the invasion of our soil has been adequately punished. The moral effect of these victories on the princes of India will prevent any further effusion of blood?will se cure the continuance of amity and peace. Fur- i ther, the elaborate pieparations, the consump tion of time and money necessary for the inva sion and subjugation of the Sikh territory will have betn spared ; and a conflict with a war like race, which, under the most favored cir cumstanced, must have been protracted, and could not fail to have been bloody, has thus been entirely superseded. Anticipating a somewhat protracted struggle in subduing and punishing the aggressors, the leading English journals have been discussing the question as to what we should do with the Punjaub when we had conquered it?when our injured honor had taken vengeance on the par ties who solifcted the conflict. The general feeling has been averse to the permanent occu pation of the couhtry. Every one feels that our Indian empire is at present sufficiently un wieldy without further extension. To seize ! and keep possession of the Punjaub would, in a pecuniary sense, entail a heavy loss, with i the certainty of constant collisions with the na tives. i The conquests of the Sikhs would involve, too, the subjugations of ihe A Afghans. Enter | tng on a scheme so gigantic, our hands would be constancy full, and an empire, the extent and diversity of which is a marvel in the his tory of mankind, might be exposed to constant and superfluous tribulations. All this will be avoided. A native prince of power and popu lirity, attached to the British alliance, will an swer the end in view?t' e continuance of friendly relations -better far than if our ensigu floated in triumph over Lahore. Such a prince is believed to exist in the person of Gholab Singh, who, more wary than the other chiefs, had not compromised himself by his hostility to the British power. With him Sir Henry Hardmge had formed a treaty for the future government of ihe Punjaub, the terms of which will probably restore order to that distracted country. NEWS ITEMS.

Tlio following itomsliow the degrada tion and misery , existing in England wlioro the system of a Tariff for protection has been fairly tried. ' Who, in this Union, wishes to Sco such immenso wealth aa that possessed by iho Dukd of Cleveland. in tlio hand of one individual, while thou sands and tens ot thousands of his fellow men, perhaps more virtuous than liimsolf, are starving for want of bread. The wrongs of the oppressed have at length reached the ears of thoir rulers, and trembling for fear of an outbreak from the ball famished operatives, tlio Ministers have brought forward a motion, which may be regurded.as tlio entering wedge towards breaking down tlio ysteut of miscalled protection.

This is a Government of reason of con stitutional law not of brute force, or hard cider and coon skin revelries, instead of argument. We hope the scenes of 1810 when the drunken log cabin revelries, at tempted on almost all occasions, to dis turb and break up iho meetings of the emociats, may never b enacted over again. 1 liey cannot be, without the flowing of blood in a civil commotion hor rible (to reflect on.

Finding that no notice was taken of his remon strances, he pushed away the wrong dom ino with his nose,' and took up a suitable one from his own piece and. placed it in its stead. , I 'hen played correctly; the dog followed and won the game.

No sound is heard save that the grey owl hoots At intervals in the old mossy wood, Or save the rustle of the aspen leaves, That ceaseless, turn upon their slender stems, When not a breath is felt in all the heaven. Standing upon an eminence, I see The haunts of men around. The world is still. The busy and the bustling are at rest; Their mingled voices do not fill the air, As when I visit here -at noon of day. The birds are silent now, and he tired beasts Are slunk to rest. Almost beneath my feet Stand cottages, the dwellings of the poor; And prouder mansions of the rich and great. The cotager and all his little ones Are slumbering now. Theirs is a sweeter sleep Than luxury and wealth can ever give, Not distant far, upon a gentle swell, With its back ground of orcharding and wood, And more immediate circle of green trees, My much loved home, my native dwelling stands. Its roof is glimmering in the white moonshine, And ull its inmates, save myself, at rest, I see the brook meandering there, But do not hear its voice; the trembling light Of the full moon falls on its shifting waves, And is thrown back in flashes on my eye. How sweet the stillness of this midnight hour! It banishes the cares of busy life. 'The spirit of the mightiest is a broad ; It fills the boundless air, the spreading wood, The wilds, the lonely deserts of the earth, And all her poplous realms. In a few hours The rosy morn will break upon the hills, And all these sleepers start to life again. 'The gay to spend another day of mirth, 'The housewife to her toil; the laboring man 'To his accustomed task. The little birds That perch in silence on these lofty trees, Shall then break forth in songs wild woodland songs, Such as wore chanted on the sixth day's morn In Eden's bowers to hail the birth of man. And summer's morning wind shall breathe again, And toss the dew drops from the forest leaves, And all this solemn stillness be exchanged For universal motion. Sttnding here, And looking on this varied scenery, spread So beautiful around, I feel a power, As of the Great Omnipotent upon me, That calls my heart to worship: I will kneel, Here by the side of this o'erhanging wood, And, like the patriarchs of ancient time, Who worshipped on the mountains, offer up Beneath heaven's mighty arch, my humble hymn, 'To the Keeper of the sleeping world.

A until oil r,np From tho Village Record. A Thrilling; Incident. The following incident, like many of a simi lar character, occurred during the winter of 1835-6; which will long be remembered for the distress that pervaded the poorer classes of the community, and deep snow which occasioned it. A farmer resident about thirty miles dis tant from Philadelphia, started the morning be fore the snow commenced, for market. By the time he reached a ullage about half way to the city, it began to snow; but not anticipating so great a storm, he pushed on, and about night arrived in Philadelphia. Disposing of his car go as soon as possible, in order to start home early on the morrow, he put up his team at hotel till morning. Still it continued snowing, and daylight but appeared to disclose to him the almost utter impossibility of reaching home in his-wagon the snow havingfallen to the depth of 3 feet! Meeting with an acqtiaintance from the same neighborhood, they concluded to at tempt it; making the task easier by leaving one of the wagons behind, and attaching all four of their horses to the other. In this manner they succeeded, alter the most painful exertions, in reaching within a mile of home. Here the roads forked and they were obliged to separate. Our hero now turned into a narrow byway, com pletely filled with snow to tho tops of the fen ces, with his two tired and jaded horses. Slow- he neared his home until a wood less than half a mile in length was all that lay between them. Into this he drove, but the crackinsr and ailing limbs warned him not to proceed. Bent on his purpose he still pushed on until a large tree which had fallen across the road, efiectual- v obstructed his progress. Unfastening his horses, he rode them back to a neighbour's house near by and told them his situation. They immediately placed his horses in a warm stable, and prepared the weary traveller a com- ortable repast. This over, and feeling some what strengthened, he declared his determina te go home on foot, through, snow up to his waist. In vain his friends remonstrated in vain they urged the folly and foolhardiness of attempting such a desperate walk. lo go through the large timber was madness, as the imbs and whole bodies of trees were continu ally giving way under the accumulated weight of snow. His course must therefore lav in a circuitous path augmenting the distance to more than a mile. His friends finding it vain to dis suade, gave ium their advice as lo the best course to pursue, and bade him 'God speed Ere he proceeded one third of the distance he repented heartily of his folly. The temporary strength imparted by his supper soon failed, and by the time he reached a little eminence with in sight of borne despair had almost seized him. fire stghl of his own candle burning cheerfully through the window, and the thought of his children depending upon him for support urged him on. Slowly he toiled, until at length ex- hausted nature could hold out no longer, and he sank within 50 yards of his own door! Oh J God! the agony of that moment. I o die with in a few yards of his door, to hear the merry laugh of his children, and see the forms of those he loved passing before the window; to be thus tantalized was too much for human endurance in vain ne attempted to snout; nis voice scarce louder than a whisper was drowned in the noise of the elemerits. At last when he had given un to die, one of his sons opened the door and came out. With a last effort the unhappy man raised himself partly up it was enough he was seen and restored to his family. This is a true narrative destitute of coloring and exhibits one of the scenes of distress and danger which occurred during the hard winter of '35-6. The Money Bee. This bee, when collecting the pollen of flow ers, which constitutes tho bee bread, never passes from one kind of flower to another, as has been supposed. If it first light upon a hon l.l- : . . ii ... uv sucivie, ii continues to collect irom tins flower until it has loaded its thighs with as 1- m. mi rnucn as u can carry away, l ne uee is gov erned in this by an instinct that makes it a co laborer in the ordinary work of re-productive ness. The pollen, fructifying dust, is carried Irom flower lo flower of the same species, and thus the bee aids the operation of nature by dis tributing the pollen, necessary to the ffuilful ness of the plants. If the bee were to pass from a clover blossom, with the pollens adhering to its body, and light upon a honey suckle, it would produce a hybrid, or mongrel species of nower. How wonderful are the operations' of nature, and certainly among the most wonder ful is this peculiar instinct of the honey bee. To delinquent Subscribers. Benjamin Franklin says: 'Printers' accounts, though small, arc good index of character Let me 4ook over my books, and I will tell you the character of every man whose name is there.

The winter session of this flourishing Insti tution, terminated on the 7th ult. The semi annual examination of the students, was, we learn, of a highly satisfactory character, both as regards the teachers and pupils. The Pres- idency vacated by the death of Dr. Rauch, has been filled for the present, by the Rev. J. W. inevix, u.u., who win also give instruction in the department of Mental and Moral Science. The services of a competent gentleman have been secured for the department of German Lit erature; and arrangements are in progress to fill the chair of Natural Sciences, which is ex pected to be accomplished by the opening of the summer session, which takes place on the 18th of May Nine Professors and Instructors will then be actively engaged. Its enterprizing Board of Trustees have the erection of large and commodious buildings in progress, which when completed, will add much to the comfort and convenience of all engaged in the Institution. At present, the College has the occupancy of the large and beautiful edifice belonging to the Theological Seminary. The number of students during the past year,' has averaged considerably above one hundred- principally from Maryland, Virginia, North .Carolina, Ohio, Kentucky, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. A large number of scholar ships are being endowed in connection with the Centenary efforts now making in the Ger man Reformed Church, and we doubt not if the spirit of liberality-, in favor of a liberal educa tion, is in any good degree commensurate with the wealth and ability of that denomination, Marshall College will soon be placed upon a permanent basis, and long exert a benign and salutary influence m our beloved country, par ticularly upon the German name and character Located in one of the most healthy and fertile spots in Pennsylvania m the midst of a grow ing, moral, and industrious population, and en- joying.the advantages of a full, learned and able faculty with the fostering support of warm and ardent friends, this Institution must rise and become a prominent seat of learning in our land, and prove a blessing to generations yet to come. We sincerely trust that while Marshall Col lege is aided and encouraged from abroad, it will not be neglected at home. Franklin coun ty should feel proud at having such an Institu tution within her bounds; and should not her citizens be disposed to extend lhat patronage which it so richly merits ? The following article from the Liverpool Standard, containssome striking truths : The Lunacy of Nations. When nations go to war without a cause and without an ob ject, their only business is to injure each other as much as possible. The extent of the mu tual injury that may be inflicted in this case is beyond calculation: for the destructive power of steam navigation has not yet been ascer tained: and such vast interests have grown up during a long period of friendly relations among the three leading nations of the earth inter ests wholly dependent on the continuance of peace that war must be more destructive economically than physically, whether to the French or the English, or the Americans. The mere bloodshed in action between nation and nation, seems a trifling matter when compared with tho convulsions of trade that would occur throughout the region of war. France would indeed suffer less than England or America from disturbance of the established order of in dustry and commerce ; but then, to make the balance even, France can scarcely go o war without the accompaniment of a political rev olution at home. While the Southern produ cers ol America and more than half the manu factures of England were ruined while grass was growing in the streets of Manchester and New York the French would be destroying each other in civils broils. And then there are the state of Slavery in America, and the state of Pauperism in Ireland, and the state of Char- ism in England and Scotland, as elements of further destruction all brought into activity by the slate of war. For doing harm in all direc tions, this war would be as signal Us for being without a cause and without an object. It would pefhaps be destructive in proportion as it was aimless. In the absence of any reason for going to war, they talk in France of send ing Steamers lo burn Brighton, arid in England of burning Buffalo in New York,arid in Amer ica of burning Montreal or Liverpool. People seem to be possessed by tho t)evih It is a clear case of the lunacy of the nations. One of the clergy of Boston fell asleep in his pulpit a few Sundays since tumbled against the door and then rolled down the stairs into the aisle. No damage done. This was teaching ef fectually, by example, the folly of sleeping in church. j. The following from the New Orleans Cres cent is very good: 'Why is a young lady like a careful housewife? Because her waist is as little as she can-make it Robert Bacon, a Prophet. In the work'of Roger Bacon, who wrote in the 13ih century may be found an anticipation of the invention of the steamboat, locomotive engines on rail roads, the diving bell, the suspension bridge, and, it might almost be said, of the recent events of St. Jean d'Acre. His own words arc these: Men may construct for the wants of navi gation such machines that the greatest vessels, directed by a single man, shall cot through the rivers and seas with more rapidity than if they were propelled by rowers; chariots may be con structed which, without horses, shall run with immeasurable speed. Men may conceive ma chines which could bear the driver, without dan ger, to the depth of the waters. Men could in vent a multitude of other ingines and useful in struments, such as bridges that shall span the broadest rivers without any intermediate sup port. Art has its thunders more terrible than those of heaven. A small quantity of matter produces a horrible explosion, accompanied by a bright light; and this may be repeated so as to destroy a city or entire battalions. The Discovery of the Telescope. Galileo placed at the ends of a leaden tube two specta cle glasses, both of which were plain on one side, while one of them had its other side con vex, and the other its second side concave and having applied his eye to the concave glass, he saw objects pretty large and pretty near him. This little instrument, which magnified only three times, he carried in triumph to Venice, where it excited the most intense interest. Crowds of ihe principal citizens flocked to his house to see the magical toy; and after nearly a month had been spent in gratifying this epi demical curiosity; Galileo was led to understand from Leonardo Deodati, the Doge of Venice, lhat the Senate would be highly gratified by ob taining possession of so extraordinary an instru ment. Galileo immediately complied with the wishes of his patrons, who acknowledged the present by a mandate conferring upon him for life his Professorship at Padua, and generously raised his salary from 520 to 1,000 florins. Sir D. Brewster's Martyrs of Science. The death of another friend of our countty is announced. The venerable Wilhelm Wil- lixk, the friend of Washington, and of many of the distinguished men which ihe events of our Revolution called forth to the aid of America, died at Amsterdam on Saturday the 13th day of February last, at 91. At the most eventful period of our revolution he came forward and raised the drooping spirits of America by fur nishing the means to recruit and support a bro ken and dispirited army. He furnished the first loan, and after the Independence his House in Amsterdam was constituted Bankers of the U. S. His eldest son succeeded him in the House, which continued banker of the U. S. until dis placed by General Jackson! about the period of the removal of the U. T. deposits. This venerable patriot often held distinguish ed places in Holland, and was one of those who ramod the present Constitution, under which King William was called to the throne. New ark Daily Adv. Good Sentiments. Agriculture is the nursery of patriotisni and virtue. Agriculture, aided by science, will make littio nation a great one. Science must combine with practice to make a good farmer. A wise government will not be slow in fos tering the agricultural interest. All the energy of the hero and all the science of the philosopher, may find scope m the culti vation of one farm. If you separate science from agriculture, you rob a nation of its principal jewel. Conundrums..  Why is a side-saddle like a four quart measure? Because it holds agalon. Why arc the flowers such severe creditors? Becauso they are always sure to get their dews. ' Massa want to know if you can't settle dis small bill to-dayj kase he wants' de money bad,'said a darky to a gentleman yesterday. 'No, I can't. This the third time you have come for that money to-day. Your master is'nt afraid I am going to run away, is he?'t ' Not 'zackly but look hea,' said the darkey, slyly and mysteriously;' 'he's a gwaoin to run away heself and darfor wants to make a big raise.

The Pot ter party, afraid to take the responsibility of supporting it openly, managed by dodging, to have it passed by a majority of two tfiirds, hi both branches of ihe Legislature. The bill would occupy, if published at length, more space than we are willing to give to it, and we consequently make an abstract of its must im portant provisions: . ; 1.

MISCELLANY From t'.ie New York Daily Globe. Old Trinity Chimes. I do not promise to give to my readers, in this simple sketch, a story of very deep or ttartling interest, but simply to relate a little romance of real life, connected incidental! v Willi the restoration of the sweet chiming of those old bells, wlch are again p?alhng from Trinity's tower in musical cdence tlirougti the air; their . sound tlriking on thej.eart with a voice of 'by-gone times,' and recalling vividly jiast tcenes and image Ling forgotten. It is many years since in a splendid inansion in the lower part of Ilroadway, a fair young creature, scarce fifteen, sat alone in her chamber, pale with grief.aod bedewed with tears tracing alternately . through ihein the lines of a closely writ ten letter, and a small ' well-cut profile. The deep, heavy stroke of Trinity's clock 'telling 'one' fell upon her ear with a st a rt 'ling, doleful sound; and roused her from the occupation the teemed to absorbed in. ''and the iudulgeneiice of a grief il wool I teem too deep to be fell by oue of ber jeart. Pressing them to ber lips with a warm Teaming of love, the deposited ll.emcare full.

Ellen keighton wat the eldest daughter of a wealthy merchant, and until within the last two yean, their only cbilj.

Naturally of a religious turn, the I treasured with avidity every good precept thrown in her way. Mr. Leighton was born in the higher circles of life, with the inheritance of a fortune, and had imbibed gay and undo meslic habits. J'or the last ten years he had been engaged in business with Mr. Tracy in a u of low origin, but possessed of shrewd business talents, great energy and ambition. II y indomitable persever ance lie bad risen from one estate to o oll er, uolil he so far ingratiated himself in Air. Leigh'on'a favor as to induce him to take bim for a partner. Their partnership had been an arnica ble and prosperous one; as if, by tacit con sent, Mr. Leightun being the iiionieJ mat, wit left almost entirely to the en joy meat of his elegant and linbltaiiiess habit9. Mr. Tracy' family was large, end rear ed with the most scrupulous regard to. fashionable acquirements and appear ances that by these Ihcy might wipe off Any statu of tbeir origin. Ellen bad been attacheJ almost from her infancy to an orphan nephew , left to his care with a few thousand dollars, about the t tine he entered into busiuess with Air. LetghloA. Nevertheless Edward Wilinot had always been represented as being a dependent on his uncle's bouuty and entertained towards-him the warm . eat feelings of gratitude fur his kindness j and parental care. Yet, high minded, generous and independent in his feelings, lie coBlJ not but feel unhappy at being .bus a dependent upon bis generosity, ..;ai.uSh conscuusmat 01 me sup '.uur.y of his wealth be was able to bestow upon bun the education lie was uvisumg upon his sons, still it did uol lesen loa leemig of humiliation at the situation which oil- times depressed him; and lately he had more cause thati ever to Cbafa under. The intimate fooiiug bis uncle's family had been permitted to retain in Air. Leigbtoo's, bad ever been in spite of iheir otherwise purse proud minds fell by them a greal condescension; and there was alwajs a decided rivalsbin among the )ouiij folks for Aliss Ellen's favor; Mason, the eldest son a few years Edward's se u ior 1eg a n n u w '1tirt-w .-fauiiia iuIq womanhood, aud himself verging inlo manhood, to think seriously of oue day becoming a candidate for her baud: and had tiecu obliged to chew the bitter pill of jealousy, observing ber evident 'par tiality lor hit poor cuusin. He had vent ed his spleen more than once, as far as he d.ired, to one be felt compelled by au irre sistible force at til times to treat with deference and respect.' Tb'e few advaucea be bad dared to make in Ellen's presence towards disrespectful insinuations, were more than the proud, ulanly spirit of Ed watd could block. , lie determined nut to tfear the galling 'chain of dependence longer. Now that be had entered upon his eighteenth yearf he insisted upon his unclu's placing him in seme situation wheie be could gain his livelihood. Air. Tracy consented, only requiring time to ii.t him iu some perma nent and lucrative business. Hitherto be had used Edwurds property without a compunction of conscience believing he was returning il to him in full valua. 11 it own that the time bad come for him to fulfil bis engagement with bis fa'lh'er.tfherr be placed il iu bis trust for bis son, there was a strife between it and bis avarice, lie would not consent to pari with that wbich he had been so long accustomed to coiiot amo.Tg bis own thousands, and place hit nephew iu an honorable independency ; but giving way to that love of gain which is the 'roof of all evil,' suffered him still to believe himself an unprovided orphan. And for a more sure furtherance ofhis re maining iu ignorance, obtained liim a sit uation in a house iu the Canton trade. Tbisvews fell heavily upon the bearl of Edward. Himself and Ellen bad already , -ghted their vows to each other, and the bought of being ibus torn from ber made him waver in accepting what be would otherwise unhesitatingly have done, aud he required day to reflect before deciding-. But hit uncle reminded him sternly that be wat subject to bit command, and bat 'He bad determined it1'EJward't spirit rote ag-iinst what be conceived to be such uncalled-for servile obedience, and with a glowing cheek and firm decided manner told bit uncle 'He wuuld never be insensible to the obliga tions he w at under to him, but that.be thuuld take the lime requisite fur reflec tion, and if, upon it, he found that he could not make up hit mind to leave bit friends and cuuotry, be would look out for a til- uatiorf for himself, and out give him any foil her trouble on hit account. He tuught bit owe room to ruminate upon his future plant.

Edward bad never dwelt upon it but with the buiyant, sanguine feelings of youth. With him, to imagine prosperity wat to obtain it; and to anticipate latireU was to gain them No he bad laid atidd all boyish thought! and feelings, and tat in hit youthful reflections in the exercise of bit manly faculties. Sage reason sat on her throne, counCilling with weakness and iiiexperieuco. She pointed to him bis orphaned situation, without an inher itance, and his dependence upon his own exertions and the blessing of God for the luturo.- Self-denial, industry and houest) she doubted not Wuuld brown that future With success. Slid whispered him the best way of manliest in,,' his luva for Ellen , and the ureal of obtaining her, was to enter with all his energies into that busi ness whic'i promised soonest to yield him an independence. The situation his uncle offei ed held out the strongest and surest inducements. Ilesiire it was hard to be separated so distant and long from li,, leu; but the time, would be every moment oc- ! cnpieu, auu mo isoor iigineueu oi us ion i fur her. To this effect he made up hit mind, and j wrote the contents to Ellen; telling her J il w s for her he undertook tins perilous voyage and promised to return fit 'I of . wealth and pent up love, to lay at her feel. She pointed out with manly, truthful sim- pi i city, their situation, and the duly ofj each to the other.

An instinctive feeling of the disap proval of the heads of bulb families had induced t he in to uuise this feeling iu so cret, aud as 'stolen fruit is sweetest,' per l,j.. t,.- ddyT--ciiai-m- n-liluli jseTfred to strengthen il. Edward's undo left hi in but few days to preparo for his departure. The last evening before his departure be repaired to steal a farewell from Ellen. Not being able to see her, he loft his address in a note with his profile. Her heart was ready to bre .k at the intelligence. It was in the silence of I. er Chamber that we left her shedding biller tears of sorrow over them. Late as it was, she had sent a serv nit with a note en treating hi in to call the next morning, if but a moment, thai they might meel once more. Edward needed but the tipportuni ly, and the tietfl morning, before her pa rents had bestirred themselvct from their conches, himself and Ellen were weeping their vows of fidelity and love in each other's arm-; As Ihey sat together lor the last time, and felt that such an immense dislance would soon separate them, EJ wuru's bearl sank within him, and his manly resolutions bad well nigh given over. She prayed earnestly lo Him who had promised lo be a fither to the father less, to Fpare them to each other, and if bis undertaking was h ilh His divine guid ance, bo besought God in the agony of his aching beail, to give them some token to cheer, an. I that ihey might build tbeir hopes upon, us a warrant of His blessing. Scarcely had he Ceased, ere' Trinity's bell.- chimed furih such a sweet peal, it rang through (heir hearts as a voice of God from His bouse of prayer a warrant, in answer to their prayers, of His blessing and protection. With a beautiful hope, sure and steadfast, these children stood with arms entwined, drinking in with iicly confidence, the deep full chiming, unlil it ceased. 'Itis His sure promise,' Ellen whisper ed, 'lhat ire shall meet again again we shall stand tngeiber and listen lo the sound of (hose sweet bells!'And there, in Ilia holy church, we will pledge ourselves to be united, dear Ellen, nevermore to be teparaled!'I promite to become your will there, Edward, in the sight of God; may mine ear cease to hear, and my tongue to ar ticulate, if I ever make that solemn row to sny other!' , They parted, and Edward sat on the deck of the vessel, with his eyes resting upon that spire, and his hopes fixed upon that heaven towards which it ever poin ted, the sound of its tweet chiming bells still ringing in his ears, as they swept over the water, and It faded from tiew a hap py talisman of bright future.

''Sah'my pipe, slowly articulated Mr. French, st.ill looking into the fire.'1 The pipe' was hanging by ihe bowl in a lit lie piece of 'toard nailed aboe ll;f roanlle-piece.'in ihicii an oblique mortisr wks cut just wide enough' lo adii.fl (he handed iomu (be pipe, and the old geolleinau proceeded Ho load her, las urn tt 8 ll any lermeu iw . mo (pa nau 1 K..U.1 Vitil a almri ilAtn.itl fan tKfi sein vrai by measurement just three in dies. All Mr. French's pipes were just the lima length. If ho bought a hsod aome new pipe a foot lung, he alwaya im- mediately broke it down to three inches. The reason of this rule was, that three inches, horizontally, carriei the bowljiisl one inch beyond (he end of his note; and (he proximity in cold weather afforded a very agreeable warmth lo that exposed organand in all weather It enablel -Mr. French to aave much of the delicious odor of the weed, which otherwise Would have been a total lots. Having 'loaded her,' he put (he item lo his mouth and drew his breath through it and blowed hia breath through it, two or three times, with decided force and emphasis, to see 'if she would breathe free.' The proof being satisfactory, he continued his conrersai ton as follows: Sal, a coal.' . . : .Sally took the tongs and selected a nice little bright coal from (he fire, and handed ! it lo (he old gentleman, who applied it to the bowl of his pipe, and drew several rapid and smart puffs through it , till a fine wavy curl of smoke began to roll from his mouth, . V -'',;. 'Sal, my hat and staff.' said the old gen tleman, rising from his chair and standing six feet high. 'The staff, which was standing behind the door, and the hat, which was hanging above it on a wooden peg, were b rough t ar.d put into his In tids. Sir. French, hav ing placed the crown of the one upon Hie j crown of his head, and the foot of tl.e'oll.er ! hy the side of his foot, dropped his con versa) ion', an J began to mnve silently to- i ward' the door.  Hot he had nut proceed ted above half way ac ros the room .before he was brought (o a full stand by an ex clamation from Mrs. French. 'Now, Mr. French,' said lha( excellent, thrifty and careful housewife, 'you ainl a goiu' to be so imprudent as to go out lliis evening without your great coat; you'll ketch your death a col.!; you don't know liuw cold it's growd since dark.''Only over to neighbor Gray's,' said -Mr. ' b ' '' French, taking Another step towards the . i ;door.

Mr. French paused again, and turned half way round. If he was hot prudent iu j anything else, he was prudent in one thing, he never stopped lo dispute with hia wife, lie had two modea of avoiding i that ugly difficulty ; one was, to surrender (he point at once, and the other, to re treat rapidly out of hearing. The former expedient was adopted on this occasiun for he ugain renewed his conversation w;th as much liveliness, and a little more authority than before 'Sal, my great-coat .Sallv. hand your father's great-coat,'understood that the garment was brought by his own order. Sally bruught the coal. It was a heavy garment of homespun wool, and a drab color. ,Mr. French threw it over his shoulders in the manner of a el Uie 8,eeve ,oo9e bj, (j t.Je j 'There now, Mr. Fiench, you are not i coin out so; put the creat coat on so it , .., m . . . -,, ,Ir.. ii.r..i, .

'Ah! Mr. French, good evening glad to see ye; I was just thinking, a moment be fore you knocked, I wished you would drop in a I i I lie while, and have a sociable smoke this evening. ' Debby, set a chair for Mr. French? ', ' 'The arm chair, Debby,' said Mrs. Gray., as Ihe child fau lo'ubey the order. 'The arm-chair was placed before a large blazing wood-fire, which was roar ing up the chimney like a young cataract . 'You must take off your great-coal, Mr. French,' said Mrs. Gray, 'or you wou'l feel it when you go. out.'The old gentleman slowly unbuttoned the coat, and Mrs. Gray helped him off with the sleeves, and Debby took it, and laid it away, and put back the hat, and staff; and presently the tall form of the visitor was comfortably seated in (lie large arm-chair by the side .of Captain Gray, lie had not yet uttered a word since he came .in to (he house, but now, drawing his pipe from his mouili, and blowijr. out a lung puff of smoke, and looking straight into the fire, he delivered one of.ll.use sententious speeches, so full of pith aud meaning, which gave a peculiar stamp (o his character. 'Cold night,' said the old gentleman, re turning the pipe to his mouth, . and rub bing his bauds together. This was a sufficient opening for Cap tain Gray, to talk half an hour. Indeed, he was so much the counterpart of old .Mr. French, that lie could talk half an hour upon anything, lie had been a farmer in early life, and then for several years fol lowed tho sea, in which time he had risen to the CT.iui i rid of a sloop coastcr--atiJ ilotr, with tliO-hocorablo title of captain, bffples in one ban and a dish of large yel and a few hundred dollars iu his . pocket , 'Mjw applesin tho oilier hand.and set them had retired again to a farm.

The truth waa, the airival of the old gentleman was iu an iiisia.il l.ai'led by (ho young folks as a joyful signal for a gathering at Mr. Fruuch'a, aud tho wink having passed from one to another round among them, they slipped out, one after another, and were all flying up the road Mike as l.raam of chalk.' . 'Yes, pretty cold night,' said the cap tain, in reply lo tho above ducoiirsj of farmer French, ' but nothing at all; a mere circtimstauce, to what I've seen it some times at this tTfiof year, coming on the cuast, wheu a nor'-wester was whistling down upon us, heavy enough lo tear young mountains up by the roots, and the spriiy was fl)ing over us mast high, and every drop that touched lite rigging froze, till an inch rope was as big round as my arm, and tho bowsprit increased to the sizs of a back-log, aud when you couldn't speak so as to be understood, unless you turned your mouth to the leeward, and used short words, for (he first end of a long word would be froze stiff before you could gel the last syllable out, that's what I call c.-ld weather, neighbor French,' said the Ci.pttin, rising to light his pipe, which he had been rather mechauicdlly filling dur ing the foregoing remarks. '. 'Yes, that's cold weather',' Said .Mr. French, looking steadily into the fire; and, as if iu somo degree inspi red by ihe eloquence of the captain, he added a re in a i liable continual ion uf Ins d iscourse as follows: , Itad lime for cows, alivavs dry up amazingly iu buch cold weather.'' Dry ii pi' said (he captain, ' why , in such weather as I've seeu, coming on the cuast this time of year, a cow would all dry up iu fifieou 'minutes, so there would be noth ing left of her but a lump of ice. Why, neighbor French, the time I was speak ing of, (he upper side of a cud's head froze us hard as a horn while the cook was fry ing Ihe under tide over a hoi fire, That's what I call cold weather.' . i . Yes, that's cold weather,' said Mr. French. . ; , , . . j ; ''Why, neighbor,' resumed' the captain, the time I was speaking- of, when the blow was a little over, we fell in with an other sloop, that was laying to iu rather strange condition, and we hailed her, but got no answer. We could see one man slaooing at tho helm, and we'hailed him but got uo answer. Then we down boat, aud went aboard; and ibere was a sight to be reme.nbered, neighbor a sight to bo remembered. Tho man stanuiog at the helm was froze stone dead, aud hard as a solid column of ice. We cut away rouod (he cabin door, fur the spray had frozti sev eral inches thick; and when we g t into the cabin, there waa the captain and mate, froze lo death, sittiug by (he table where they had been eating dinner. The mate had a piece of frozeu polatoe iu hia mouth, and (be captain hud a piece of meat on hia folk, which he still held in hia baud. The cook we lound iu ihe ca- Ooose-house, with hn feel poked into (he stove and burut Iu a coal, and the real of his bod) froze as hard as 4 alone. 'That's what I ealrcoWweatber.' 1' il Yea, that's old weather,' said uld, air French, without turning his bead or his eyes to the right or left. That was cold weather worth talking about,' said Captain Gray, going to the fire to put a new coal into hia pipe, whicli had nearly gone out during his speech abotil cold weather. Yes, that's cold weather worth talking about,' said old Mr. French, with' rather more than hia usual emphasis.'Here Captain Gray began lo call over the roll of his children 'Jerusha!' no an swei J 'John!' no answer; 'Thomas-Debby Guo rgc!' no anwer.  '. ' ' ''Wli, what has become of all these boja and gals?' said Captain Gray'impktiently; 'seems lo me they are out of the way irtfshty quick.' '''I don't think there is one of them in the house, aaid .Mrs. Gray; 'I guess they I areswery one of them over at Mr. French's by'iliis time. What do you want, Mr. Gra'yl for I guess I shall have td wail upon you'myself.' ' - Vby, I wanted a mug of cider,' said the Captain; 'I can't have a Comfortable tmke without a mug of cider before me.'' '0, well, 1 can help you to that said Mrs' Grays so aivay she wrtit to the cel lar1, and brought'in a largo mug of cider, and set it upon H.e ' nicely swept hearth before the fire. Tl en she went oul again, . and . oon returned with a dish of large red bor l1 ranch , said the captain 'Yes, that looks something lik e it,' said the old gentleman, slightly changing the angle of his vision torn the fire to the mug. A comfortable smoke' of uu hour long now followed, during which the captain told with much spirit some of.his long sea stories, while Mf'. Freno I. responded at suitable intervals, iu short pithy sentcn- lies, generally repeating the last words of l the captain. After getting down into tho second mug of cider pretty well towards the bottom, however, Ihe old geiilleman's tongue was observed lo be a little loosen- ! ed; and bis ideas to flow with somtwhat ; accelerated motion; so that he gave the j captain considerable valuable informal ion , respecting ll.e number of loada'uf wood he ; had pilad up in 1 1 i s door yard, tho coiidi-! lion of his cat lie, baru , cellar , tiro .

We do notthink it is a healthy state of feeling -lertain we are it is one which the far mer would,' and of right should, be the first b condemn were it indicated bv the conduct of any of those we have before mentioned. - We are anxious that the far mer should assume and maintain the place to which he is entitled in the com munitythat his influence should be felt, not passively, dui aciiTeiy ana mat ne should personally maintain a watchful su perrision overfall' matters that properly belong to hiro,, things which can only be done by the acquisition of knowledge. This is the magical key which, directed by industrious hands, opens the sources of wealth and power. We do not wish to hare the farmer become a speculatist and vagarist; we do not wish to have him ac quire knowledge to make him proud and ashamed of his business ; we have no wish to see a book or even a paper in his bands when they should be holding the pleugh or gathering the harvest; but there are hours enough in the heat of sum mer, and the long evenings of winter, if properly employed, to give him a general knowledge, of the science of agriculture, the nature and qualities of soils, and the improvements making in his business. That iarmer does not stand an eaual chance for success he does not enter the held of competition fairly and on equal ground with the better informed, if he aoesnot receive some valuable agricultur al journal, and make it a part of his read ing. We have no wish to dictate his choice. We are happy to say there are several in the country deserving the most liberal support and circulation, and which we think no one can read without interest arid profit ; but we won Id most earnestly urge upon every firmer the consideration whether the soundest principles of utility and economy do not demand that they should give, by immediate subscription to some work of this kind, a proof that they are not ignorant or inattentive to their true interest. G. PRUNING APPLE TREES. If is not advisable to prune very freely, but to commence before the trees become very large, and by a frequent and moder ate trixnrain'g, prevent the growth of a thick and crowded top. The operation should be so performed that the straight est and most thrifty branches may remain ; and their distance asunder be such as freely to admit light and air. ' In pruning, branches should be cut off as closely as possible, provided it does not occasion too broad a wound. The place is then sooner covered with a new growth of wood. r In general, wounds more than an inch in diameter, should be protected from air and. moisture. If not, they be come dry and crack, and let in the rain and rot, or admit insects. Tar, mixed while heated fith a quantity of whiting or pounded chalk sufficient to prevent its run ping, is an excellent application. Or Nearly, the same purpose is effected if brick dust, or even fine sand, be substitut ed for whiting. Pruning apple trees may be advanta geously performed any time during win- FUEL. Among, farmers it. is a very common practice to have their fuel, where re-pla-ces are used, chopped readv for burning, in the woods; and when intended for the stove, it is in the same place cut into three or four feet wood, as the case may be, and then at the house sawrfintp proper lengths for burning. Wood, in many parts of our country, is already an important article, and i rapidly coming so in- all, since most of our land holders and farmers are more anxious to destroy trees than to plant them,' appearing to be equally in sensible to their beauty and their value. In this state of things is it not a decided waste of means, for a farmer to get his wood in the manner above described ? We think it is and though reasons plen ty as blackberries might be adduced, we shall content ourselves with one. In cut ting wood, when on a tree of two feet in diameter, the chopper, if he understands his business, will, at commencing on a wg. ujite out a cnip, or call as it is called, of from sixteen tq eighteen inches in length, i This, where the lots are cut of the aver ageJength of three feet, will cut up into chips at least one fourth ofthe wood, and these in most cases are left where they falbto rot. Now every housewife knows, that when wood is drawn in what is called sled . lengths, or Jogs of twelve feetr and these are cut up in the wood yard of the house, that the chips furnish a very valu able and convenient part of her fire wood: and every-farmer knows, that though when cut in this way many chins will bp fine and unfit for burning, yet they are &t from , being lost, quicldv rottinz when scrpea into neaps, ana wnen arawn and spread upon his land furnishing manure Of a most valuable kind.

ELEGANT EXTRACT. From a Sermon on War, by Rev. Dr. Cbann!nK. ' The idea of honor is associated with war. But to whom does the honor be long ? If to any, certainly not to the mass ofthe people, but to those who. are partic ularly engaged in it. The mass of a people, who stay at home and hire others to fight, who slep in their warm beds and hire others to sleep on the cold damp earth, who sit at their well spread board, & hire others to take the chance of starving, who nurse the slightest hurt in their own bodies and hire others to expose themselves to mortal wounds and to linger in com fortless hospitals, certainly this mass reap little honor from war. The honor be longs to those who directly engaged in it. Let me ask, then, what is the chief busi ness of war? It is to destroy human life, to mangle the limbs, to gash and hew the body, to plunge the sword into the heart of a fellow creature, to strew the earth with bleeding frames, and to trample them under foot with horses hoofs. It is to batter down and burn cities, to turn fruit ful fields into deserts, to level the cottage ofthe peasant and the magnificent abode of opulence, to scourge nations with fam ine, to multiply widows and orphans. Are these honorable deeds ? Were you called to name exploits worthy of demons, would you not naturally select such as these ? Grant that a necessity for them may exist. It is a dreadful necessity, such as a jrood man must recci! from with in stinctive horror ; and though it may ex empt them from guilt it cannot turn them into glory. We have thought that it was honorable to heal, to save, to mitigate pain, to snatch the sick and sinking from the jaws of death. We have placed among the reverend benefactors of the human race, the discoverers of aj.ts which allevi ate human rufferings, which prolong, comfort, adorn and cheer human ;if?, and if these arts be honorable where is the glory of multiplying and aggravating tor tures and death ? The Intellect. One proof of the superior and independent excellence of lofty endowments, may be found in the fact that the brute creation have got the senses in far greater perfection than man, and yet their external knowledge is ablank in comparison with his. A raven can scent its prey at a distance of many leagues; a hog can smell a truffle that is buried un der the earth ; an eagle can see an object with distinctness at the distance of several miles ; the fall of a leaf cannot escape the ear of a sleeping hare ; the polypus, says Dumeril, is capable of receiving light n self by its fineness of touch ; most quadru peds are enabled to distinguish more accu rately between wholsome and poisonous herbs, than the most accomplished and la borious botanist ; and yet by his intellect alone, man is able to triumph over the comparative deficiency of his senses; and with inferior modes of acquiring knowl edge, to nsetotnat prodigious superiority which he possesses. Ltvzrpool Slave Trade. It is melancholy to be obliged to remember, that the African slave-trade hns been one of the principal means of the growth, and one ofthe great sources of the wealth of Liverpool. During the ten years from 1783 to 1793, it employed in that trade, in all, 878 ships; imported to the West In dies 303,737 slaves, the price of whom averaged 50 each: making dEl2,l?6 830, $62,796,880. Deducting allowance to factors, &c, the actual revenue to the town was 1 2,294, li 6, or $59,0 1 1 ,756. An abatement should be made from the number of ships as stated here, the sum being made by adding those registered in each successive year; as the same ship, in some cases, might have been employed for half the period, more or less. Say 300 ships. As this estimate comprehends onlv a minor fraction of the period during which this traffic was tolerated by Great Britain, it may, perhaps, fairly be supposed, that me numoer 01 s arps actus iv mHc K,. the Liverpool trade alone was considera- t : i . j i J J b,v mo.r? than. double this number, and ' auuiuuudj mtume io mis town, irom that source, proportionate. The history of Liverpool, published in )795, from which this statement is abridged, has giv en the items with great particularity, ap parently as if it were a part of the honest and lawful trade of the town no more discreditable or improper than trade in logwood and ivorv !

The following con trivance for catching mice, will perhaps be new to most of our readers: Provide a large earthern pet, With a hole an inch or two in diameter in the bottom, (a large gardener s flower pot will do,) invert it on a board or flat smooth stone, and sink it in the ground, until the bottom of the pot is about level with the surface. Suspend, about two inches below the hole, by means of wire, a smooth wooden roller, which should be capable of turning fieely on its axis The surface about it may be sprink led with chafTor short straw, and grain or seeds, and the roller be besmeared with lard and other attractive substances. Up on this roller the mouse leaps, and it im mediately turns by his werght, and precip itates him to the bottom, from whence he cannot escape, as it is impossible for him to climb the sides. Many may be caught in the same trap without the trouble of re setting. By burying the pot in mellow earth or sand it is easily taken up and re placed. This mtthod is particularly adapted to catching mice in gardens, cel lars, &c. Monthly Genesee Farmer. Female Gamblers. A new gamb ling house has been opened at tho 'West End,' London, for the accommodation of Ladies ! Indian Massacres. In all narratives of suffering, a single well-authenticated individual example affects the feelings more sensibly than the most eloquent gen eralities of wider spread calamity. Of this nature is the following statement by Mr Cooley, of the New River light-house, Cape Florida. N. Y. American. When he approached his once peace ful home, he found the body of Joseph Flenton, of Cecil County, State of Mary land, who acted as instructor to his chil dren ; his body was mangled, and he bad evidently been killed with an axe. His two eldest childitn were found near by. shot through the heart, one holding yet the book in he,- hand she had been jearn ing, and the look of the other lay by his side ; apout a hundred yards off. he found the bodhs of his wife and infant. She, also, had b.-en shot through the heart, and the same ball, it is supposed, broke the in fant's arm. His house had been burnt, but the house in which he kept arrowroot! and the machinery with which he manu factured it, are leit uninjured.

A discovery of considerable importance has been an nounced with regard to preserving grain. To preserve rye, and secure it from in sects and rats, nothing more is necessary than not to fan it after it is threshed, and to stow it in the granaries mixed with the chaff. In this state it has been kept more than three years without experiencing the smallest alteration, and even without the necessity of being turned to preserve it frn humidity and fermentation. The experiment has not yet been made with j good morals and good learning, we w:. wheat, and other kinds of grain; and j also to be considered of the same familv -thev may, probably, be preserved in chaff! Ifwp can do anything by our labors to with equal advantage -N. E. Fa rmer. Liberty of the- Press. Among the most important events which have oc curredjn Europe during the year 1&35, may be included the abolition ofthe liberty ofthe press in France, a bo'd and arbitra ry measure, which Louis Phillipe deemed necessary for the security of his throne; and the assemblage of the despots of Aus tria, Prussia and Russia, at the camp of Kalisch, to confer on measures to be adopt ed for perpetuating among their subjects, and extending through all Europe, 'igno rance in its most revolting shape, and the odious doctrine of blind obedience to the will of tyrants. But the effects of despo iism to restrict the march of mind will be unavailing. Tyranny will make a des perate struggle to preserve its dominion in Eu rope, but is destined, ere long, to be swept away and numbered among the evils which once existed. Bos. Mer. Jour STOVES.

We are glad to see, even at this late lay, our state banks evincing a disposition to resume the specie payment of their notes. The 1st of January is spoken of; they were the first to decline and will be the last to resume. Our bank advocates in this part tell us that it is the fault of the government the government the specie circular the whole blame is to be thrown on the government; but does not (the federal) the same government exist here that existed in Louisiana, in New York, and other places, w here they have good money. In these places they 1iave no U. S. Bank to regulate the cur rency,1' yet it is good. Tho cause of our rotten system must be found at home in bad management and over issues : this is socn and felt. Truly has the Gallatin Star said: A strong and just spirit of op position is every day manifesting itself to the shameful abuses ofourpresent wretch cd banking system. A 1'RINTINQ TltESS. Science is the knowledge of art and art is the practice of science. Never, for the use of man. has a finer combination of these been made, or exhibited for his admi ration, than is found in the press used for printing the New York Courier and Enqui rer, of which tho proprietor says, our pa per is now regularly worked upon this ad mirablo machine, at the rate of six thous and sheets per hour, Tho machine was invented and built by D. Nat-iet, of Lon don, and is tho second of the kind ever constructed. It is unquestionably the fast est Printing Machine in tho world, nnd in case of emergency can be made to work evcn thousand sheets per hour. It is worked by the same steam cngino which Ave have usod for the last four years, nnd requires eight persons to put on and take effthe sheets, besides a superintendent -and pressman. The space which it occu pies is fifteen feet square and eighteen Tiigh, and all who tee it in operation can not but admit that it is ono of the most compact, ingenious and beautiful machines ver exhibited, ' THE CHEAT WESTERN. , This famous ship has again arrived in New York; she made her trip in 10 days, with adverse winds and severe gales; she had 1 13 passengers. The Now York En quirer says: We perceive that the Trans atlantic Steam Company advertise that they 1 have re-chartered the steamship Itoyal William, and purchased tho new aleamship Liverpool, for the navigation of this port. That tho former will sail on the 20th of this mouth, and the latter on the 20th of October. Wo may therefore count on stoam communication with Eu rope throughout tho winter, of which there was before some doubt indeed, the navi gation of tho Atlantic by steam may now be considered permanently established. 'Biddle and his colleagues usurped the merchant's places in the cotton trade) not confent with that, they have entered, by the aid of British capitalists, eagerly and extensively into that of the Sugar trade. The immediate result is advance in price, which the consumer must pay to swell the coffers of those Bank Itag merchants, who make and circulate the rag money, and grow rich as the people become poor. A writer in the Kentucky Gazette says, and truly says: Those speculators, forming a collu sion with foreigners, will next engage in the bread stufl'of tlje country, which system hail its first appearance and origin in the aristocracy of Great Brit ain subjecting the people to starva tion, that they may become good loyal subjects to their rulers in abomination. Distress is their favorite principle of operation, like those in the trallic a mong us for they live, like vultures, on the distresses and miseries ef their fellow creatures. There was a time when the indepen dence of the people would not submit to an insidious tea tax by British us urpation. But their allies the pres ent generation of Wiggcry, may sub mit in brothcily love, without a dissen ting voice as one people, the engros sing principle of speculation in sugar, cotton and bread-stuffs. Every thing is doing to assimilate our policy and condition, in the over trading of the country, and the money jugglers of foreign banks modestly soliciting congress to L'ive our paper a legal tender claussc. In the alliance, aud. with the distresses of uandcrs m the pursuit of tythc titles, through the political power . and sordid operations ot a splendid bank, fcc. 1 he federal party no sooner elected Mr. Adams, the friend of Biddle, antimasonry, &c. than they assumed the royal name, in the pretended form of National Whigs, like Timon, the man hater. In fact, they wanted a splendid government (and his salary) extended to 50,000 dollars per annum. For these pur poses and the right of succession, they have invoked war, pestitence and fa mine, regardless of law, union, pru dence and decency. The halls of the capital have became the battle field of the combatants in battle array. Webster, and other revolutionists of blue light memory, at a dinner in Bos ton, remarked, such was their new reading of the constitution, in which they were unable to find any power to authorize them to take care of the f)eople, but only a power to provide or themselves. He dwelt at length, and expressed his opinion, that until this doctrine was abandoned, and some action had by Congress, either by chartering a National Bank, or some o'her way, for the regulating of the currency, things would not settle down to any permanent and steady basis. More sophistry and nonsense we never read. He speaks of the new reading of tnc Constitution that is, not as he read it in 1816. and he wants the bank to take cate of herself and not the people, or things cannot politically settle down on a steady basis. The pusilanimous  display of Mr. Webster s weakness, compared with his former sentiments, is satisfac tory proof of the Federal party disguis ing themselves under the name and ti tle of whig?. If we look to their origin, wc would suppose them to belong to the mushroom tribe, that spring up in a night, stiling themselves republican whigs of the first water distressed for political titles, without any merit in securing or fortifying their county's independence. Tho following is from tho London Cor respondent of the New York Enquirer: dated, London, Sept. 7, 1838 : Tho cotton market atLiverpool has been altogether tending downwards for some days past, for the excellent business in the American trade is not sufficient to sustain the prices of the material at a time when there is so much stagnation in the home and in al most all other branches of foreign trade. The stock on hand is also much larger than in preceding years, and the growing cropa in the United States be ing believed to be also considerably larger than the last, with the .Egyptian (government, at length, commencing to. dispose of a stock of upwards of 90,000 bales, gives the manufacturers reason to believe that the prices will be lower, and consequently purchases are obser ved to be made almost entirely from day to day. Excepting that the stocltt. are held by large capitalists, by whomjasV the .Liverpool market is sustained lrom depression, there is little reason for doubting that the prices would fall to soim considerable extent. In miscellaneous American securi ties the transactions continue to be large in the aggregate; but the price is powerfully operated upon by the weight of stocks which is daily offered, and which daily continues to arrive. At the close of the Exchange this af ternoon, the following were the quota tions merked: New York 5 per Cents. 1850, 93 a 91; do. lSG0,91a 95; 'Pennsylvania, ioixj-y-;), vi a yj, utno, i.)t,'Jl a 92; do. 6 per Cents. 1855, 99 a 100. do. 6 per Cents. 1850, 100 a 101; Lou isiana, (Baring's) 9G; do.

At a dinner given lately, at Beaufort, South Carolina, to the Hon. 11. Barnwell Rhctt, tnc following toasts wero given i The President of the United States. A Northern man with Southern principles. We go for principles, not men. By W. Elliott The Administration They have taken tho position which se cures the great interests of tho South. To withhold a cordial support, will be fjci ther generous nor just. The Southern Star says, Again it be comes our painful duty to record another death in our count v. bv violonre. on Thurs day last, Judge Thomas Keller was in his field, about six miles east of this place, gathering corn, when an individual by the name of Carpenter came into the field, and made use of some abusive language, when Judge K ordered him out of the field, from which some harsh words ensu ed, when Carpenter left the field and re paired to his house and got his rifle, and stationed himself in the garden, and shot Judge K. at a distance of upwards of one hundred yards, in the small of the back, which caused his death in about twenty minutes. Carpenter fled, but wag pursu ed,- taken, and now stands committed for trial at November Court. BE IT REMEHHfcBED By every freeman who wishes to remain so; That the Federalists are in favor of making bank paper tho acknowledged cur rency of the country; That thev want to lorce tho Uovern- ment to take the notes of every bank in the United States, when there was scarce ly a bank note in the country that would pass current ono hundred miles from the place where issued : That they coalosced with the iiank ol England to produce distress; That they have determined to make the people suffer, because they are democrats, and because they support the Dcmocrotic men; That they have declared (Free suffrage to be a curse to any people That they refused to grant aid to the Governmentjat the time of extreme emer gency; And that they boldly declared, the sin gle end and aim of tho Federal purty is to get into power. Let the people remember these things. Keep them constantly before you. They contain sentiments that should never be tolerated in a Republican Government. Irenton Lmporium. We cut the following from the Southern Sun, the organ of the whig party, it shows that the Whiffs are not tor forcing a re sumption of specie payments, in an arti cle preceding the resolutions passed by the Natchez Banks, fixing upon the 1st of Ja nuary next, as the time for a general re sumption, the editor says, many of our banks good and solvent banks cannot possibly be ready to pay specie at the contemplated time, sucl i institutions should have a little indulgence. It would not be fair to urge them too precipitatoly. Sou tliern Star. The JVew Orleans banks have a uni ted circulation of paper of $7,500,713, and 3, 418,337 in specie. wmm a a & is. si id .

I must tune up my heart's broken string, For the fair has commanded his strain, But yet such a theme will I sing, That I'll think she'll not auk mo again. For I'll tell her Youth's blossom is blown, And that beauty the flower must fade; And sure, if a lady can frown, She'll frown at tho words I have said. The smiles of the roso-bud how fleet! They como and as quickly they fly; Tho violet how modest and sweet! Yet tho spring sees it open and dier How enow-whito tho lilly appears! Yet the life of a lilly's a day; , And the snow that it equals, in tears To-morrow must vanish away. Ah! Beauty! of all things on earth, How many thy charms mUBt desire! Yet Beauty and Youth has its birth, And Beauty with Youth must expire. Ah, fair ones! so sad is tho talc, That my song in my sorrow I sleep; And where I intended to rail, I must lay down my harp, and must weep. But Virtue indignantly seized The harp as it fell from my hands; Serene was her look, though displeased, As she uttored her awful command. Thy tears and thy pity employ For tho thouirhtroHs, tho piddy, the vain, juuiinoso who my blussings enjuy Thy tears and thy pity disdain. For Beauty alono ne'er bestow 'd Such a charm as Religion has lent; And the cheek of a belle never glow'd With asmilo liko the smile of content. Time's hand, and the pestilnnco rage, No hue, nor completion cun brave; For Beauty must yield to old ago, But I will not yield to the grave. jbo s o s a a a est E ia SENTIMENTS BY SIMON 8NOBBS, ESQ Condemn not in others wnat seem to be faults, until you know you arc right yourself. Flatter no man to gain his favour: for by so doing you add falsehood to hypocrisy, and lay yourself under an obligation to yield him that respect which he docs not merit; and which you are loth to give. Never marry a woman who keeps a lap-dog for she who can bring her mind down to love so contemptible a thing, can never elevate it to that dig nity which man requires. Seek not to discover the faults ol a friend for rest assured, if he has any they will show themselves as soon as you wish to see them. An honest heart is a jewel; he that possesses it is a mine undiscovered. 1 he best proof of a woman s fove is her attachment in adversity; and the best proof of her infidelity is her neg lect in prosperity. He who advertises his absconding wife is a brute; she who publishes her husband is a fool; the world hold one in disgust the other in contempt. A rich man is a slave to his feelings a poor man to his wants. Independence is a term like space, eternity, or heaven, much talked of, but little known. A contrary wife is to her husband what an unruly horse is to his master, a beast of burthen. Prejudice to the soul is like a drou-'ght to the soil, it distroys the best plants and leaves the rankest weeds to grow. Candor is one of the best traits of the human heart, but so seldom seen, that it is never duly appreciated. Wisdom and Virtue are seldom found in the same heart; because one is de rived from a knowledge of mankind the other from an ignorance of it. Virtue is a plant of so delicate a tex ture, that the breath of suspicion often kills it. Nature is a good teacher, but he who follows it is a poor scholar. Our feelings vary as our fortunes change, as a picture receives its colour from the light in which it is viewed. Montesquieu says, Knowledge hu manizes mankind, and education re fines it; but prejudices eradicates eye ry tender disposition of the heart. Intelligence is the brightest orna- . mentj and modesty the most attractive charn of female charactcr- A woman who will kins a lap-dog, betrays a weakness of mind, a strength of passion, and a corruptness of taste, that when indulged, will lead to the destruction of all that is worthy of love, admiration and esteem. Love is a passion in some, a senti ment in others but that which is foun ded on esteem is the most rational and of longest duration. Disappointment can be best borne when we know that by receiving it ourselves, we do not inflict it upon others. Editors and porcupines are-alike in one respect, and unhke in another; they fight with the same weapon, but the strength ol one lies in his cause, the other in his quill. Wit is a diamond, whose lustre is never dimmed by age. Brevity is the soul of wit; it is therefore best sometimes to possess the soul without the body. GENERAL MAXIMS FOR HEALTH. (From the fourteenth edition of a very sensible little book, entitled, The Frugal Housewife.) Rise early, eat simple food. Take plenty of exer cise. Never fear a little fatigue. Let not chldreu lc jivcovJ ;0u l.u.., it is necessary their limbs and muscles sbonW hv.f..n r'iy, u you wish lor cither health or beauty. Avoid the necssity of a physician, if you can, by careful attention to your diet. Eat what best agrees with your system, and absolutely abstain from what hurts you, however we'l you may like it. A few day's abstinence, and cold water for a beverage, has dri ven off many an approaching discase If you find yourself really ill, send for a good physician. Have nothing to do with quacks: and do not tamper with quack medicines. You do not know what they are; and what securi ty have you that they know what they are ? Wear shoes that are large enough: the contrary not only produces corns, but makes the feet misshapen, and cramps them. . Wash very often, aud rub the skin throughly with a hard brush. Let those who love to be invalids drink strong green tea, cat picfclcs, preserves, and rich pastry as far as possible, eat and. sleep at regular hours. Wash the eyes thorougly in cold wa ter every morning. . Do not read or sew at twilight, or by too dazzling a light. If far sighted, read with rather dim light, and with the book somewhat nearer the eye than you desire. If near sighted, read with a book as far off as possible. Both these imperfec tions may be diminisoed in this way. Clean your teeth in pure water two or three times a day; but, above all, be sure you have them clean before you go to bed. Have your bed-chamber well aired; and have fresh bed linen every week. Never have the wind blowing directly upon you through open windows dur ing the night. It is not healthy to sleep in heated rooms. Jjpt children have their bread and die before they have been long uTftv Cold water and a run in the fresh air before breakfast. NEW NAME.

The paper which they now discount, amounts to four hundred mil- liocs of dollars a year. Almost all of their decisions are made by one of these men, who is ao familiar with his business and the responsibility of business men, that he runs a handful of acceptances through his bands and pronounces upon Ibem, in less time than a bank teller pays his bank notes for a check. The resources of the house are so vast, lhat ihe Bank of England has found itself quite unable to dictate to them, and to indulge in rivalry with them. One of the partners, it is said on good authority, is in the habit of giving away from his share of the profit, a hundred thousand dollars annu. ally. N. Y. Jour. Com.

The Philadelphia Ledger is wast ing a great deal of valuable learning, wrath and criticism on Shakespeare, Shy lock and Governor McNutt's veto of the humbug resolutions passed by our beauti ful Whig Legislature, on the false, fraud ulent and deceptive declaration that we will  settle few if we never pay. . The Ledger has not dared to reply to, or at tempt to refute, the masterly and unan swerable arguments advanced by Gov, McINutt against the paymerri ofthe State Bonds, illegally sold to Mr Nick Kiddie, the arbiter of taste, morals and finance in Philadelphia. But the editor spins out columns in wrath and criticism on a little Buncomb which the Governor threw in bis message for (he special benefit of the small fry who had neither honor, hon esty or intellect to investigate the great principles involved in the question. The editor of the Ledger's mouth is sealed on the cant of State ho.ior with which the swindling Miss. loafers stun the pub. lie ear. Pennsylvania has never redeem, ed the faith which she pledged sixty years Hgo. She bas never paid the honest far mer for the property for which she issued lier plighted faith then; and she would not have the impudence now to impugn the character of Mississippi for refusing to pay bonds sold illegally to Mr, Riddle for 'he Baron Rothschild, and the other bloodsucking fundmongers of Europe. We gava a specimen of the unredeemed faith of Pennsylvania a few days ago, & to keep that patron of swindlers in coun tenance, wc accompanied it with others of the Old Congress and Maryland. We could add Virginia nnd North Carolina to the list of States who never yet have re. deemed their promises, and what is more, who never will redem them, though these states got value received for their promsos and used this value in the public service! But we need not stop with any of the States of the Union. We have examples of the same character in the proudest and most powerful nations in Europe. Both England and France have repudiated their public debt at various times, h ranee nev er paid her assignats, neither did she ever redeem ner nana, issues unoer eym tern of Finance. It is ridiculous now for the ignorant and knavish financiers, fools and fundmongers to pretend that Missis sippi can ba disgraced by refusing to pay her bonds, bounht and sold in utter viola. lion of her constitution and la'vs; and it is still more contemptible in the editors and organs of Pennsylvania, who have encouraged their swindling banks for the last three years in violating their faith & robbing the public. When Pennsylvania pays her own debts and compels her insti tutions lokeep their faith with the public, then let them hold up their heads and talk about honor and pood loith. But until thnt time arrives let tho editors nnd organs of Pennsylvania and Maryland hold down their heads when honor honesty and good (aith are subjects of discussion. There are iufinitely honester and better men in our penitentiaries than those legislators and editors who advocate an irredeemable currency, and the continued robbery of the prooucting classes tor the henetu oi the bankers borrowers, speculators ana fund-holders of this country and Europe.

It is stated in the Plough Boy/' an ^ fljfricurtiiral paper recently commenced * in South Carolina, that if a small piece of sulphur is thrown on the fire every day rtbe bacon is smoking, it will effectually ^ prevent skippers and bugs from entering.

Registrr. 1 t Whitney's Cotton Gin seems likely to i ' he superceded by a new machine for I 1 cleaning cotton and wool, which appears f to have been introduced with success at I , XiUVclli J/uss. The Courier of that < place gives the following a -count of it. t ? ... , : nmtri The machine nns neen iiivcihuj mm cj patented by W. W. Culvert, of Chelmsford, and Alonso Crane, of this cily. It je consists of u common feed apron from I which the cotton passes through the rol- j lers and thence taken by a common pick- i cr and thrown info comb-toeth arranged i on a solid iron cylinder, and thence is la- i ken forward under a revo'ving floated : wheel guard. The fibres of cotton are 1 therv doffed from the combteeiii by re- i volving brushes, and lurned out from all > foreign substances, The secret of the r success of this machine in cleansing col- r ton, lies in the ingenious arrangement of \ o ^ t j the floated wheel guard, in conncciion t j with the comb-tceth. i The advantages of machine over a Whitney's cotton gin, may be easily seen. The latter has been in u*o successfully ever since its invention, but docs not j leave the cotton perfectly clean, and t injures the staple in some degree. With I this machine, there is no chance for for- t eign substance to pass through ; and the r operation of it shows that the rotten is I j much better cleansed by it an I with for \ less injury to (lie ^tapiv. Even cotton c waste, no matter how much dirt it con I twins in ?v t>e perfectly cleaned and ren- i dere 1 Hi foi use. The inventors have already taken out (patents tor their machine in Scotland, p England and her colonies. One^of the a inventors is now in Europe, with two of s the icachmcs, which are now p*ob:ib!v v m operation at Leedt or Manchester.? t This machine will thus be brought to the t notice of manufacturers in Europe, and n if they examine into its operation, they n cannot out feel satisfied that it is to their b interest to adopt it. It is intended to 4j take the place of Whitney'a cotton gin, ,, which I.as gained the inventor so much n fame and been so useful to the world, and b with all the marked advantages it posses, ses over that machine it must necessarily ? do so. From its operation, every one r must feel satisfied (hat it is a far better ? machine than Wliitne}'s. i The new machine has been in success- a fill operation at the mill of lire Lowell a Company for six months, and has been ^ perfectly successful. From rough estimates, it lias been ascertained that a tlmce foot machine of this description, w ill gin t ikrti.coinl r.% hundred lbs. t iJIUJii u.?t uiwinuiMi ?'? in?vv>? of cotton |)cr day, leaving the cotton quite li I clean, and without any injury to the ?i staple.

Some may thin it would be more appropriate to give fi your funning paper the signs of a go< husband-r/kzn. but lot I hern remember tin these sign* are to be hung up in ti Ladies Department, as a Rowland f< your Oliver ip a late number. Betsvet a good husband and a good husband nu there is an obvious distinction. A m.i may be a good husbandman, or conce 9 ; avaricious, ignorant, and ill.tempore J j husband?-one who?e great delight' ia- to 11 ? bullV his children and hoard his cash ! s But no man can at once be a bad lather . and a good husband, for ignorant or cruel 9 treatment of children implies it hare (lise regard of the feelings of the wrlc.-^My - promise to indicate tho signs of a good i husband extends only to the relationship i established by marriage between the t groom and his bride ; and the unreasont ableness of expecting her to make a good i housewife, as described in your paper of a * ate date, if her aim and efforts to keep / all things in order are not encouraged 3 and sustained by him. Let us take Inrri np, then, from the l rising of the sun to the going down thereIn the first place, then, I hold it to be t out of the question that n good husband - j should be a late sleeper ! Can any one t i irnairino any habit moro unmanly, not to e say unclean, than to see a full-grown * man lying snoring in bed, to dumb forgettulncss a prey, long after 44 the glori oils king of day has risen in the east? Such an example of improvidence and sloth is unseemly in itself; and yet more j pernicious irt its effects Upon all around * | hi.n. As when tire 44 cut's away the rfiice 1 do plav, so servants are quick rn learn* r ing to take advantage of the slothful ways ' of their master, and with late rising and ' laggnrd servants, how can the best housewife, even i\Jrs. Glass herself, have her J house made clean and all things kept do'cent and in good order? No, sir, he '? who rises late has to run after his business f all day, and can scarcely overtake it at night, as Poor Richard say.?;, end even * were the habit of late rising in the hus^ ^ band reconcilable with anyj?Gt notion of ,r Health or of economy in other countries, * in ours, where property is so often divided * and where every man, therefore, roust Ire b the architect of his own fortune, there are * few, if any in whom it is not absolutely ' culpable to lie abed after sunrise. Not only is early rising then, a sign of a good husband, in a degree to ronJor it an absolute and indispensable virtue, but if ha would have for his <Vvn gratification a nice breakfast, in good season, he will lake care to have hi3 house servant up, jnd doing at early dawn. He will so systematize matters that the cOok and washerwoman shall have always nt hand a supplyof g/>6d wood and water for kitchen and lauriclfv, not leaving them, as too L..

Only let hhn keep his a head combed, his heard close, and his per son and garment* in immediate contact 1 therewith always clean, and all the rest maybe of  leal tier or prunella for me. v To extend the sketch of his homaly and ^ ; practical duties, on the observance of ,j J which he must depend for that great Mas? sing, a good hnrixewrfe, they may alt . more easily comprehended by asking ourj selves what is expected of her. Is it a clean house from garret to cellar? then let him provide her with good servants, inw dustrious and docile, with gm>d brooms c and brush s. water convenient and abun I dint, and what is too often not to be a ! found, n good strong scraper nT every iu I - % tm out-door, for iho feet of all who enter n j thereat, that the snow, and mud, and 3 j dirt which arc brought in, may be left j, ; outside the house. ~ If it ho his pleasure to uee himself ro. ... fleeted by his shining brasses, let him not (. grudge n lip's worth of rotten stone to e polish them; though for my part I would r banish brasses and nil other costly and jf superfluous furniluie, besides first cost, j requires daily labor to keep it in order, h j without contributing any thing tu our l0 ' real comfort; and the money saved in this *s 1 item should he expanded in additions Ui e j the family library.
